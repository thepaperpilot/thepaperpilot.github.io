Consumer boycotts are the collective refusal to purchase products from a set of companies for political reasons. They're an example of [Direct Action](/garden/direct-action/index.md).

## Goals of Consumer Boycotts

Boycotts have many goals. All boycotts are going to exercise [Solidarity](/garden/solidarity/index.md), help us feel like we're truly living up to our values, and demonstrate our collective power as consumers, although those aren't typically the primary goals.

Sometimes there are explicit demands trying to be met, such as a law being passed or company policy changes. Famous examples are the [Montgomery Bus Boycott](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/montgomery-bus-boycott) that ended bus segregation in the US and [Anti-Apartheid Movement](https://www.aamarchives.org/campaigns/boycott.html) that boycotted goods from South Africa until Apartheid was abolished. You can see a list of recent changes believed to have been caused by boycotts [here](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ethicalcampaigns/boycotts/history-successful-boycotts).

Other times, the goal is simply to reduce demand for unethically produced products. Famous examples of this form of boycott are veganism and various "Buy Local" campaigns.

## Boycotts are not Stunts

In my experience, a lot of recent boycotts have been framed as political stunts. An image will go viral on [Social Media](/garden/social-media/index.md) telling everyone there's a boycott coming up and to get ready. It'll include a defined start and end time, and the targets to boycott. Unfortunately, despite their virality these kinds of boycotts routinely result in zero long-term change. They're only effective at making people feel like they accomplished something, which can actually lead to them feeling like they've "already done their part" and not participate in action that actually could result in positive long term change.

Boycotts do not need a specific start time. The best time to join a boycott is right now. There is no reason to delay the start of the boycott. "Sending a message" by having everyone start and end at the same time does not increase the effectiveness of the boycott, but can make people feel like they "missed" it and not participate.

Boycotts should also never have a specific end time. If there is a specific demand being made, then the boycott ends when it is met. Otherwise, it should continue indefinitely. If it'll end on its own after a month or two, companies have no reason to take it seriously.

If you need a call to action to start boycotting, consider this an evergreen call to action. The best time to join one is _right now_.

## Sustainable Boycotts

Boycotts must be done in a way such that they can continue indefinitely. If it can't be sustained for a very long time, it will struggle to actually be effective. The Montgomery bus boycott lasted over a year before successfully ending with bus segregation being abolished.

First, this means you cannot take on too much at once. You must be able to continue life with the boycott, albeit inconvenienced. This is why boycotts are typically targeted. It simply will not be feasible to boycott everything you've determined to be unethical or otherwise not worth supporting. You just find a subset of boycotts that you know you can manage upholding indefinitely. In this regard, boycotts calling to halt "all economic activity" (such as the "economic blackout" on Feb 28, 2025 which was likely offset by increased purchases before or after) are innately unsustainable, barring a handful of homesteaders who are de facto boycotting most things already.

If you're approaching boycotts as a difficult but temporary burden, you will eventually burn out. What this means is you need to be able to fully cut this product out from your life, or at least use an alternative to it. This requires fully changing your consumer habits. While it is possible for the boycott to end, you should not assume that day will come, certainly not in the near future. Remember the boycott is a continuous practice and every additional day continues keeping the demand lower and increases the economic pressure on the company. Not purchasing unethically produced goods is itself a victory, even if it doesn't cause the corporation to change its ways.

If a boycott is sustainable, its demands and goals can be ambitious. As a boycott goes on, and potentially grows to include more participants, demands become increasingly feasible to reach.

## Caveats

A lot of the advice here specifically applied to _consumer boycotts_. Other forms of collective action, such as work strikes and rent strikes, do not necessarily play by the same rules. While I still don't agree with having a pre-defined end time, strikes can often be effective much sooner than consumer boycotts, for example.

Additionally, be wary whenever specific companies are championed as the ethical alternative, especially if that company is a giant. Corporations may adopt ethical branding while retaining other exploitative practices. This is called "rainbow capitalism", and includes things like making products that support progressive causes like BLM or trans rights while exploiting child labor or union busting. These companies may try to co-opt those progressive causes by suggesting the solution is "ethical consumption", which is not a replacement for systemic change.

## Who to Boycott

Boycotts are most effective when a large number of people participate, so consider joining existing boycotts that follow the advice I've given here, such as the [BDS movement](https://bdsmovement.net/get-involved/what-to-boycott).

Supporting small businesses instead of corporate giants can slow monopolization, but many small businesses still exploit workers. Do research to find those worth supporting, such as worker cooperatives or businesses with ethical labor practices.

As far as product groups go, becoming vegetarian or even vegan are really powerful boycotts for protecting animal rights.

If possible, just try to buy less in general. Reuse the things you buy, try to repair before replacing items, and seek out ways to buy things with minimal or even zero waste, such as using refilleries or buying bulk groceries. You can find such stores [here](https://www.litterless.com/wheretoshop).

Boycotts alone wonâ€™t dismantle unjust systems, but when done strategically and sustained over time, they become a powerful tool in the broader fight for change.
