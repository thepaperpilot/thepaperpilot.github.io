An [Anarchist](/garden/anarchism/index.md) principle that argues people should be able move freely, both physically and socially. It mandates a complete lack of borders and nationality. This creates a social landscape filled with completely autonomous agents with no power over one another. Instead, everyone simply has a reputation and only interacts with those deemed to be in good standing. This acts as a form of [Decentralized](/garden/decentralized/index.md) [Decision Making](/garden/decision-making/index.md) and even a form of [Police Abolition](/garden/police-abolition/index.md), as state violence is completely replaced by social consequences.

Relying on social consequences is feasible because people are social creatures and typically do not desire or are not capable of being fully self-reliant (although if someone chose to do so, they wouldn't be stopped). People are naturally incentivized to not harm others and to work together. The main reason this doesn't already happen under our current system is due to things like the [Profit Motive](/garden/profit-motive/index.md).

I believe a potential concern with free association is incidental or even purposeful segregation. I think a society built upon this value will likely need to make efforts to promote diversity. However, over time I think the underlying properties segregation occurs over (race, gender, nationality, etc.) will naturally wither away and this will cease to be an issue.

Free association is sufficient for even large scale projects like trains, factories, or nuclear power plants. The information required to do those well and safely are not owned by the state, but rather the people. We will continue to learn how to improve these processes, and there will be enough people willing to learn and perform the duties required for these projects. You don't need a state or even something like consensus democracy to recruit people to help. Although, a consensus democracy could exist ephemerally during the lifetime of the project to handle decisions related to the project, such as the route the train should take or the design of the carriages. They'd likely also survey the people around the locations involved around the project to ensure there are no objections, including environmental ones.

Free association would also mean no longer having black and white laws to follow. Taking an extreme action that is deemed justified by the people around you would confer little ill consequence. There would be no injustice because everyone is independently choosing whether to associate with the alleged or not, and are inherently supportive of their own decision.
