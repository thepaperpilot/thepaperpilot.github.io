A form of democracy where people vote for representatives who then vote on the actual issues. The US has a representative democracy. Representative forms of government were once useful for their logistical simplifications, but now primarily serve as a way to limit the range of acceptable political opinions/options and to perpetuate the reign of those in power. A representative will never be able to truly represent all the held opinions of all their constituents, and even if they could, they'd still have all the issues associated with [Majoritarian Democracy](/garden/direct-democracy/index.md).
