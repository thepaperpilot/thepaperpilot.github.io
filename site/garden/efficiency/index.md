Efficiency is a very important value in today's society. That's quite fair, it's hard to say efficiency should ever just be ignored. However, I think it's importance is currently over emphasized, and there are times where efficiency is not so virtuous.

[Education](/garden/education/index.md) is an inefficient process. Practice problems are exercises that serve no practical purpose other than helping make sure we do things correctly when it actually matters. Similarly, me updating [This Knowledge Hub](/garden/this-knowledge-hub/index.md) is a part of my [[Constructivist] learning process, and there are certainly significant parts of it that are largely repeating ideas found elsewhere. But writing it down here forces me to process that information, engage with it, form connections to other concepts, and potentially even make a novel insight somewhere along the way. Either way this process helps ensure I actually understand the material.

One thing I've come across a lot is just how much redundant information is out there. Yes I'm contributing to it, but even without me there's still so many experts writing about topics that will naturally make the same points, each trying to be a more complete document that whatever came before. But I think that's okay, because we all process information in different ways which means those different books might better convey that information to different readers, and perhaps frame things such that different new connections can be formed. In this sense, I'd like to think this digital garden is hopefully more useful than just a mere recommended reading list. A good metaphor for this is how memes spread across society being endlessly remixed and combined with other ideas.

In some cases, I think intentionally making processes inefficient can serve societal benefit. For example, misinformation is a major issue. I think making sharing stuff have more friction / take more effort will help prevent the spread of misinformation _relative_ to the spread of correct/good information. That's part of the reason why I think [Orchard](/garden/orchard/index.md) would be a better form of social media.

Slop content, like I've criticized some [Video Essays](/garden/video-essays/index.md) of being, are partly problematic due to their inefficiency. What could easily be explained in a paragraph has to be stretched to at least the 8 minute mark and all too often to hours of content.

A video over this topic I particularly enjoyed is [In Defense of Inefficiency](https://youtu.be/7-_rK0KkB6k) by Zoe Bee. It, and most of the texts I reference in this garden, are likely more robust versions of the knowledge I've constructed here. In this case this video was what sparked the initial creation of this page (which is typically how pages get created, although some times they're branched off a page I feel is getting too long). You'll still see this document as more than just a rewording of course, and this document will change over time as my understanding of efficiency gains increasing nuance.
