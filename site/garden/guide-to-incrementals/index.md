# Guide to Incrementals

This is a comprehensive guide to Incremental Games, a genre of video games. It will explore defining the genre, why it's appealing, and how to design and build your own incremental game. Along the way will be ~~interactive examples~~, snippets from other creators, and relevant material to contextualize everything.

> Note: This is an incomplete document. I want to keep adding opinions and opposing views from other incremental games developers, and add interactive examples to illustrate various points regarding game design and balancing. Consider this a living document - and see the changelog at the end.

> Note: This was made before my switch to a digital garden, and is written as prose.  Hope you don't mind!

## Why am I making this?

That's a good question! What authority do I have to be making this guide? I haven't made the best incremental games, nor the most incremental games, certainly not the most popular ones either. But I do have some formal education in game development, know a lot of incremental game devs (as well as other game devs), and have a passionate interest in ludology, classifying genres, etc. I've also made [a couple of incremental games](/garden/my-projects/index.md)) myself.

If you have any additional questions about my credentials or anything on this site, feel free to reach out!
