Direct action is an [Anarchist](/garden/anarchism/index.md) principle arguing people should "be the change they want to see", rather than going through representatives or other authorities. It includes things like protests, [Mutual Aid](/garden/mutual-aid/index.md), and other forms of political or economic change that individuals can participate in, outside of voting.

In the context of an already anarchist society, this refers to people actively improving society by seeing a need that can be filled and filling it. This is a volunteer process, but collectively is more than enough to sustain the population. Anything that isn't getting done by volunteers was definitionally not important enough to justify doing. The _really_ important stuff, like maintaining food, water, shelter, and health, _will_ get done because of people's interests in having a society that can, at bare minimum, sustain its citizens.
