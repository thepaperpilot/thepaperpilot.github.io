Electric vehicles are, for sure, better than ICE vehicles. My family has a Volkswagen EV, even. But, let's be clear that pushing EVs as the solution to the pollution of cars is a [Neoliberal](/garden/neoliberalism/index.md) myth that simply isn't true.

It's a neoliberal idea that the solution should be consumers changing their habits to buy electric vehicles and essentially leaving it up to the free market to fix global warming. It's a neoliberal idea that we should, instead of exerting political will to get cars further regulated and build publicly funded alternatives, we should exert economic will to get things done. And of course, it's very neoliberal for the government to help the environment by just giving tax incentives on purchasing EVs, _especially_ when they don't apply to used EVs.

The real solution to the environment impact of cars is building public transit and other environmentally friendly alternatives to driving. It requires infrastructure changes, which you can help get done in your local community by participating in local politics.
