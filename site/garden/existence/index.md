Existence is an interesting philosophical concept. We "exist", and the things around us "exist", but what does that actually mean? Personally, I believe existence is tied to having some sort of effect on a conscious observer, and the scope of that existence is limited to said observed. This aligns well with my views on [Constructivism](/garden/constructivism/index.md) and has interesting interactions with Sartre's Existentialism.

## Existentialism

Sartre argued that our existence is defined by ourselves via our experiences and choices throughout life. This applies to conscious observers, or "being-for-itself" as Sartre put it.

Inanimate objects still exist despite their lack of consciousness and ability to make choices. Sartre called these "being-in-itself". They exist, but in an entirely different form from conscious observers.

## Social Constructivism

Social constructivism argues that we learn via our experiences, essentially building a mental model of reality - always imperfect, but increasing in nuance as we gather new experiences. In this framework, objective reality arguably doesn't "exist", only our subjective perception of it does. Existence, then, is dependent on a conscious observer whose mental model defines what exists to that observer.

This creates interesting conclusions about just what exists to any specific person. There may be a person living in a home 20 miles away from you who you've never met, will never directly interact with, and that you have never learned anything about. They exist to many people, as part of a collective social "reality", but nothing of their existence is present in your mind or mental model of that reality.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, you may read a dozen books detailing the adventures of a fictional character. You'll know their actions, their feelings, their motivations, their relationships, but there is no physical entity you can go and meet. In your mental model that has such a strong representation of this fictional character and an absent representation, which one truly exists?

This is perhaps quite radical, to imply a literal human being may exist less than a fictional character, but the point is that the person only exists in the abstract idea of what a person could be that exists in some abstract idea of what a house could be. The fictional character, by having an impact, an effect on you as the observer, is a more concrete existence to you specifically.

## Further Reading

[The NO/existence/N of you AND me](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873080/The_NOexistenceN_of_you_AND_me/) is a VN that discusses existentialism and related philosophical ideas, and was what led to me initially making the connection between constructivism and existentialism.
