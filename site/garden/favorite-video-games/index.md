In addition to the games I have pages on, I also enjoy these games:
- In Stars and Time
- Legend of Zelda
- Outer Wilds

I seem to really enjoy visual novels and narrative focused games in general. I also really like games about time loops, like LiS, ISAT, and OW, but also several that didn't make the favorites list, like loopers. Perhaps that's part of the inspiration for [Kronos](/garden/kronos/index.md)??

I also really like [Incremental Games](/garden/guide-to-incrementals/index.md). My favorites from that genre are... also looping ones... but that's probably coincidental. Those are ones like Stuck in Time, Increlution, Cavernous II, and of course Loops idle. Besides looping incremental games, I'm a big fan of Untitled Space Incremental.
