A movement to make more and more of society "child free" zones.

I believe this is associated with the growing [Neoliberal](/garden/neoliberalism/index.md) trend towards making children increasingly the responsibility of their parents and not the community as a whole. Likely also stems from the adult supremacy baked into western culture. I suspect it overlaps with [Anti Natalism](/garden/anti-natalism/index.md).

I believe kids should be allowed to exist in most places, rather than isolated to places with only children and their parents. It's important for kids to be exposed to people, culture, and the rest of society in general.
