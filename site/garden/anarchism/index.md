Anarchism is a political philosophy centered around the idea that authoritative hierarchies are unjust, and aim for a society completely devoid of a state. They see a state as inherently self-preservationist and oppressive, thus that it has no place in society nor the transition to an egalitarian society.

Broadly speaking, flavors of anarchism can fall into 3 categories: collectivist anarchism, which is what this article will focus on; individualist anarchism, which are right-wing versions of anarchism based on [Individualism](/garden/individualism/index.md); and modern anarchism, which are adaptations of collectivist communism to include additional hierarchies, such as anarcha-feminism which seeks to abolish the patriarchy in addition to class hierarchy. I'm personally biased against individualist anarchism but align with the values present in many collectivist and modern flavors of anarchism. I believe an ideal society is one with strong [Local Communities](/garden/local-communities/index.md) that operate as a collective; spreading power as thinly as possible to avoid the possibility of any individuals becoming corrupt and abusing their power.

## Decision Making

To keep that power spread thinly, anarchists desire decision making systems that ensure no one rules over another, although in practice sometimes some concessions are made for logistics. Ideally, an anarchist society rely solely on [Free Association](/garden/free-association/index.md), but there are historical cases of using consensus or even majoritarian democracies.

Anarchists would not typically assign explicit roles to people, but rather expect people to tend to do things that fill perceived needs and benefit the society through mutual aid. If there is a decision making process that _does_ lead to some responsibilities being assigned to a specific person, that role would have to be considered replaceable at all times, so that the person assigned the role can freely leave the agreement. This would also lead to a form of accountability, since the group could choose to assign someone else to do that task.

Free association would naturally handle most other needs for accountability. It would certainly remove the need for any form of police. The guarantee of one's needs being met should almost entirely eradicate crime anyways.

## Anarchy and Capitalism

The definition of individualist anarchism, one of the three categories defined in the introduction, is quite contested amongst anarchists. Some deny that its [distinct from collectivist socialism and worth consideration](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/joe-peacott-individualism-reconsidered), others claim it [includes anarcho-capitalism,](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/geoffrey-ostergaard-anarchism-blackwell-dictionary) and yet others deny that capitalism [is even compatible with anarchism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq-full#text-amuse-label-secf0) at all. As the broad categories are just trying to make it easier to analyze different flavors of anarchism, I think its sufficient to say individualist anarchism is not really a useful term, as it typically needs clarification upon use of what individualist anarchism means to that author specifically.

I will take a strong position in favor of the argument that capitalism is inherently incompatible with anarchism, though. Capitalism inherently forms hierarchies by introducing currency as a coercive force that is then required for continued survival. Anarcho-capitalism, the theoretical blending of capitalism and anarchism, argues for a stateless society with a market economy, effectively instituting laissez-faire economics. Anarcho-capitalism argues this market would regulate itself naturally due to the exchange of goods being purely voluntary, however this ignores capitalist incentives that would trend the economy towards wealth accumulating in the hands of the few. This creates a coercive hierarchy, which is not voluntary due to people's need for food, water, and shelter. The only way to avoid this unjust hierarchy would be with a form of regulatory body that would be nothing short of a state. Therefore, anarcho-capitalism is not compatible with anarchism, because despite their shared antipathy towards states, they do not share the underlying antipathy towards hierarchy.

Anarcho-capitalists argue that their vision of anarchism is the [only form that could possibly exist in reality](https://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html), as any other form necessitates a state in order to handle things like the redistribution of private property. However, this argument itself implies the necessity of private property as a concept. Collectivist forms of anarchy such as anarcho-communism or mutualism demonstrate how economies can work without private property.

## Anarchy in the Workplace

Typical American corporations are very hierarchical, with a few hands at the top having ultimate say over the company - what it does, how much it pays its employees, who it fires, etc. Worker's co-operatives are alternatives to corporations that are entirely worker owned and operated, with a flat hierarchy that meaningfully improve worker's rights and [help shift society more socialist](https://jacobin.com/2024/05/cooperatives-dsa-left-strategy-solidarity/).

This dynamic means technological progress works in employees' favor, rather than owners' (since the employees are the owners). For example, lets say some technological innovation made employees twice as productive. Under a capitalist structure, the owners would have no reason to increase compensation based on the increased production, and in fact would be discouraged from doing so. They'd likely either use the increased productivity to sell more products, or half the workforce to cut down on significant expenditures. Under a socialist or anarchist structure, the needs and desires of the people are most important, so workers are likely to either see increased compensation due to their increased productivity, or reduced hours without a reduction in compensation. The co-operative could still decide to also just utilize the increased productivity without reducing hours nor increasing compensation, but the decision to do so would have been consensually made by the workers themselves, not their boss.

China enacted a [policy](https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/insights-and-events/insights/2024/01/employees-participation-in-corporate-governance-under-the-revised-chinese-company-law) in 2024 to make all of its corporations operate democratically, with a "Employee Assembly" made up of up to 100 workers, that can decide on things like firing supervisors or, in big companies, appointing 1/3 of the board of directors. That goes a long way in democratizing the remaining private businesses in China.

Naturally, it should be made clear that having worker's co-operatives and currency at all is a nice reform that can ease the tensions of capitalism, but will not lead to a fully anarchist society. At most it would bring us to market socialism.
