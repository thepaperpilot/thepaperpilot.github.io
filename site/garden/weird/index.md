# Weird

> Referenced by: [Commune](/garden/commune/index.md), [Fedi v2](/garden/fedi-v2/index.md), [The Small Web](/garden/the-small-web/index.md)

[Weird](https://weird.one) is an [Open Source](/garden/open-source/index.md) project by the [Commune](/garden/commune/index.md) team currently in development

Aims to make creating [Personal Websites](/garden/the-small-web/index.md) with [Federated Identity](/garden/federated-identity/index.md) available to everyone
- Also plans on having paid tiers for giving people access to single user instances of various [Fediverse](/garden/fediverse/index.md) tools

Long term, Weird wants to build a new better fediverse
- It's being built on [Iroh](https://iroh.computer), which allows for decentralized identities that are not reliant on any specific servers continuing to exist
- Their current plans are laid out in [Next Gen Federation on Iroh: Graph Data & Linked Documents Layers](https://github.com/commune-os/weird/discussions/32)
- Erlend discusses some of the implications for identity specifically in [Weird Netizens](https://blog.erlend.sh/weird-netizens)
- I have my own high level take on how this new fediverse would look like in [Fedi v2](/garden/fedi-v2/index.md)
