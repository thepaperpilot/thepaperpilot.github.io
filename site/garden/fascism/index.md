What is fascism?
- Militant authoritarianism, removal of rights
- Hyper nationalism
- Scratch a liberal, a fascist bleeds
	- Liberals will side with state and capitalist structures, making them impotent against or even complicit with fascism. They're unlikely to ally with leftists.
	- Hell, the Democrats are making this argument today as they continue to believe success will come from further alienating the left and moving right
- Fascism is capitalism in decay
	- Essentially, that fascism arises in response to the contradictions of capitalism resulting in crises


## Anarchism vs Fascism

Anarchists fought fascists throughout history
- https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andrew-flood-remembering-the-anarchist-resistance-to-fascism

Communists spread propaganda about anarchists being fascist or anarchism leading to fascism
- [Makhno vs Trotsky in Ukraine](https://libcom.org/article/destroy-makhno-movement-bolsheviks-secret-war-against-nestor-makhno-and-his-insurgents)
- Communists try to argue their reasoning is scientific and anarchists' utopic, even though they're both rooted in materialism
	- This gets at a broader issue with people using appeals to science fallaciously. See [Scientific Constructivism](/garden/scientific-constructivism/index.md) and [the alt right playbook: doublewrong](https://youtu.be/IqeFeqInoXc)
	- For example, despite using the term "scientific communism", Stalin believed in pseudosciences and rejected genetics.
- They argue anarchism creates a power vacuum, as if the anarchists who were just fighting fascists would suddenly just start following a fascist leader
- Right wing anarchists/libertarians contradict [Anarchist](/garden/anarchism/index.md) values, in ways more similar to fascism than liberation.

## Communism vs Fascism
- Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
	- French communists initially didn't join the resistance against fascism because of this pact as well
	- FWIW a lot of countries had non-aggression pacts with Germany at the time
- USSR conquered territories taken over by Nazis and eventually won the war at the Battle of Berlin
