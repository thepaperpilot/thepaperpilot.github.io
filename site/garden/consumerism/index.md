Our society has been trained to consume in excess. We can live sustainably yet not in excess if we unlearn consumerism. Things like using zero-waste stores (or "refilleries"), buying in bulk, etc. can make a meaningful difference. You can also try to reuse or repair things instead of throwing them away. Hell, offer things for free on Craigslist or BuyNothing to give them to your community. And make use of these yourself - reuse things others offer, check things out from your local library of things, etc.

Also, while anti-consumerism is an important and useful movement, remember it alone isn't enough. Consumerism is a systemic issue that demands systemic, individual, change. This makes an impact but should be seen similar to [Consumer Boycotts](/garden/consumer-boycotts/index.md) in that you're practicing [Solidarity](/garden/solidarity/index.md).

Keep in mind "ethical consumption" doesn't really exist and above all the goal should be to _buy less_. Recognize greenwashing and don't take it as an excuse to buy _more_.
