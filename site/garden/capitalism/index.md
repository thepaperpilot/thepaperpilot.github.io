Capitalism is an economic mode where the means of production are owned by the capitalist class. Capitalists are a class of people whom make money by owning wealth and assets rather than working. That is: they invest in businesses, own the factories and machines required by workers, and pay wages to those workers, and in turn extract profits - more money than they spent. In contrast, workers contribute to the production of goods and services, but get paid wages that are strictly less than their produced value.

In this way, wealth is extracted from the workers by the capitalists. This is why we have the phrase "all profit is theft", commenting on the inherently exploitative nature of working for an entity that you do not have control over yet that controls the means of production.

The means of production and surplus labor value account for all infrastructure and labor required to produce, market, deliver the product or service and any other overhead required like HR or IT. The act of owning the factory, the machines, the trucks, etc., however, is not labor.

## Contradictions

Marx described how the various modes of economy have had various contradictions that cannot be resolved without moving to a new model. In the same way the contradictions of fedualism brought about capitalism, Marx argues the contradictions of capitalism will continue to clash until they, in turn, bring about socialism.

Not all of contradictions are necessarily urgent or even actively worsening - it'll fluctuate over time. To a degree all of these have caused crises at some point that have required some level of change to "reset" the contradiction back to a state where society can continue on. For example, credit cards were introduced to delay the contradiction between the working class getting progressively poorer and capitalisms needs to continue selling goods. Note that this doesn't solve the contradiction, only delay it. Ultimately none of these contradictions can truly be solved without replacing our mode of economy.

These crises get worse as these contradictions grind further and further and it's only a matter of time before no amount of regulation or other reaction will suffice other than complete replacement of capitalism.

Some of these contradictions are as follows:
- Capitalists require infinite growth despite a finite world
- Capitalists desire automation and similar innovations to reduce costs, but people rely on those jobs to survive
- Since capitalists make money by spending money, you have a positive feedback loop where those with the most money today will further accumulate wealth into fewer and fewer hands
- Workers can afford less and less, so corporations have fewer and fewer buyers
- The economy inventivizes monopolization, which can lead to increased costs and decreased quality of goods
- People have to spend increasingly large amounts of their lives laboring to afford to continue living, but have a finite amount of time to give
- Quality goods may need to be purchased less frequently, so corporations are financially inventivized to make things designed to fail after awhile
- The necessities for life, including food, water, shelter, and healthcare have all been commodified and are increasingly unaccessible

You may find different lists elsewhere; this is less an exhaustive list and more of the contradictions I've noticed first hand or read about and resonated with. In essence, a lot of these boil down to the [Profit Motive](/garden/profit-motive/index.md) optimizing for profit rather than things like quality of life, the environment, and ensuring everyone has their needs met. Some day the profit motive will necessarily have to be removed from society. Mathematically society cannot continue forever under capitalism and we'll have to progress beyond this capitalist period. We're not at the end of history.

## Further Reading

[Why We Can't Have Nice Software](https://andrewkelley.me/post/why-we-cant-have-nice-software.html) details how capitalism's incentives prevent us from actually getting good versions of things, especially software. Effectively capitalism optimizes for inefficient solutions. I really liked this paragraph:
> LLMs are a way to make software take orders of magnitude more computational power, electricity, and human labor, while delivering a product whose extremely volatile quality is impossible to assure. The work will never be completed; it will only create the need for ever more labor.
