Extrinsic motivation reinforces control and obedience rather than long-term behavioral change. Intrinsic motivation, in turn, is about our freedom to do what we personally find interesting and important.

[Grading is a Scam (and Motivation is a Myth)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe-SZ_FPZew) by Zoe Bee discusses [Grades](/garden/grades/index.md) as bad ideas because they, as with all extrinsic motivators, actually stifle intrinsic motivation and from there negatively impact our future behavior. It's an interesting video that shows made me think about the trend of using gamification to encourage positive behaviors, even "against" ourselves. I wonder if gamification just reinforces [Individualism](/garden/individualism/index.md) and is ultimately counter-productive. Towards the end she describes a better educational system that aligns with what I've described in [Decentralized Education](/garden/decentralized-education/index.md) and [Constructivism](/garden/constructivism/index.md).

Extrinsic motivation also decreased ambition. Why read the harder book or take the harder class if it means your end goal - getting an A - is harder to accomplish? Relatedly, why do the work yourself when you can do it easier with ChatGPT? Especially if it can do the work better than you, as is the case for an increasingly long list of topics. To a degree _all_ forms of cheating are at least partially caused by the extrinsic motivation grades provide.

The fame and glory of influence from being a big youtuber or having your name on a important scientific paper also needs to plagiarism, not rigorously confirming information, or other bad practices. I think fame and glory are extrinsic motivators that are _really_ hard to remove, but it is _possible_ to do by moving society by focusing less on specific individuals making discoveries and things (e.g. the "great man" theory) and rather acknowledge these successes as caused by everyone working together and our collective body of knowledge and ability.
