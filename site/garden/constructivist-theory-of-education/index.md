Constructivism is a theory of education that argues for knowledge being constructed piece by piece as a student interacts with people and otherwise has new experiences. It deems the construction of new knowledge as inherently dependent on the observer engaging with the material and connecting it to their existing knowledge.

As you'd expect, this theory is related to [Scientific Constructivism](/garden/scientific-constructivism/index.md). Specifically, constructivism argues our knowledge is based on the real world, but ultimately an imperfect recreation. So we are all building our own subjective understandings of the world, and adapting that understanding whenever our experiences challenge that understanding.
