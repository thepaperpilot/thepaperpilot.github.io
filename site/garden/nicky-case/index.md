<span id="6637ada3-53a0-4905-ad9f-bfd65c85df17">[Nicky Case](https://ncase.me) is an online creator famous for her various games and explorable explanations, which I regularly reference and think about. They created https://explorable.es to catalogue various explorable explanations and tools for creating them, although I believe they left the explorables community after some drama.</span>

Their [patreon blog](https://www.patreon.com/ncase/posts) goes over 2 decades of work, thoughts, and struggles Nicky has faced.

I discovered them through their game [Coming Out Simulator 2014](https://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014), which really struck a chord with my sister and I.
