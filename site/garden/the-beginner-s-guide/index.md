My favorite video game of all time, bar none. This page will be light on details because its one of those games you should really play yourself. Playing the game and thinking about its messages is an important part of the experience.

The game broadly comments on the relationship between creators and consumers, and it can apply to all forms of art (not just video games). Its perhaps also an important commentary on parasocial relationships.

Important analyses:

	- I'm overall happy to hear he's in a different place from when he made the game. There's a part of me that wonders what if we'd gotten more games like TBG, but it may have detracted from the brilliance of TBG, and I don't want him to have to be a tortured artist for our pleasure
