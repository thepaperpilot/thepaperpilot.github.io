# The Beginner's Guide

> Tags: [Davey Wreden](/garden/davey-wreden/index.md)

My favorite video game of all time, bar none. Created by [Davey Wreden](/garden/davey-wreden/index.md)

The game broadly comments on the relationship between creators and consumers, and it can apply to all forms of art
- Perhaps also an important commentary on parasocial relationships

Important analyses:
