I think the way people define themselves is really interesting. I think the current way we identify each other, via first and occasionally last names, or nicknames, has a sort of flattening effect that obfuscates the multi-faceted nature of the identity behind it. I wish identities were more "compositional", like how I describe in [the Identity section of Fedi v2](/garden/fedi-v2/index.md#66527b3e-58af-41c4-8345-5c0951e42f54).

And in general, identities shouldn't be attached to certain "domains" like one particular interest. e.g. I don't want to (just) be `thepaperpilot@incremental.social`, I'd rather my identity be defined as the composition of my interests and/or credentials.

I think our memories are tied to our identity very strongly, to the point where "myself" and "my memories" are near synonymous. I think that helps explain why people want to "leave a mark" on the world, write memoirs, and create things in general. It's why the idea of losing memories is so painful, be it from watching a loved one develop Alzheimer's, thinking about yourself develop it, or various concepts in fiction that revolve around erasing memories of things.

[goat.rest](https://goat.rest) describes a society in which people, once they come of age, choose their own name. I think this would be a good thing to have in our own society, as it would help normalize the idea of people changing their names, and offer an opportunity for those who wish to change their name but don't want the stigmas currently associated with doing so. In general, I want people to be able to more freely "update" their identity throughout their life, to something they can more strongly associate (identify) with.
