# Government

I'm definitely a [Leftist](/garden/leftism/index.md), and believe our end goal should be a classless, stateless, moneyless society. This society should be based on [Free Association](/garden/free-association/index.md) to handle both decision making and ensuring people act pro-socially. This would be a post-scarcity society where everyone's needs are met via [Mutual Aid](/garden/mutual-aid/index.md), and likely a good deal of automation. I believe in maximizing personal liberties so long as one is not actively harmful to others, which includes disallowing most forms of discrimination. A society built on free association would have no need for police.

I'm less certain on the journey to reaching that society. I'm anti-[Imperialist](/garden/imperialism/index.md) and believe imperialism will greatly hinder our progress towards that society. I'm not sure if we would need a transitionary state like MLs suggest, but I'm fairly confident one way or the other, a revolution will be necessary (hopefully a peaceful one). I think the BLM protests of 2020 may have been the closest the US has gotten to a peaceful revolution in a long time, and am hopeful that perhaps the general strike of 2028 will be our next big change at it.

Until the revolution, I'd support policies that bring us closer to the ideal society. [Market Socialism](/garden/market-socialism/index.md) essentially outlines my goals for reformist policies until the revolution. I also think pay should be equalized across everyone in the same role. This would help reduce race and gender pay disparity and allow people to take a break from their career (having a baby, going back to college, experimenting with another industry, taking a sabbatical, etc.) with reduced negative impact. Working hard would still be incentivized due to the collective ownership of the means of production. I'd also support open borders, defunding the police, and not getting involved in foreign conflicts, including stopping the destabilization of successful socialist projects.
