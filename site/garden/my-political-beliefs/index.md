# Government

I'm definitely a [Leftist](undefined), and believe our end goal should be a classless, stateless, moneyless society, but acknowledge the role of the state in defending against, at the very least, [Imperialist](undefined) forces abroad, so long as they exist.

I want to eventually reach a society structured as decentralized local communities that operate through [Consensus Democracy](/garden/consensus-democracy/index.md) , and freely associate with other communities for larger scale organizing, such as building and maintaining a rail line.

# Economy

I believe we should eventually arrive at communism; a post-scarcity society where everyone's needs are met via automation and without the need for currency. Along the way there I expect us to democratize the workplace and work towards nationalizing every idustry.

# Society

I believe in maximizing personal liberties, so long as one is not actively harmful to others, including most forms of discrimination.

# Security

I'm against the use of violence by anyone, including the state. I believe in [Police Abolition](/garden/police-abolition/index.md) and am against the military and espionage both foreign and domestic. I believe in the [Anarchist](/garden/anarchism/index.md) value of free association, so I believe we should have fully open borders, both for travel and immigration/emigration. I am anti-imperialist and believe in a fairly isolationist foreign policy, but am not against humanitarian foreign aid.
