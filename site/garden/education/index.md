I believe education is really important, and our current system flawed. Education has always fascinated me and many of my jobs when I was young involved teaching in some way. Over time my critiques have been increasing in number and at odds with more fundamental aspects of how we approach education.

Personally I would like a [Decentralized Education](/garden/decentralized-education/index.md) system that uses [Constructionist](/garden/constructionism/index.md) approaches. Those two pages should give a fairly comprehensive look at my vision for education in an ideal society would look like.

If you're reading this before the revolution ðŸ˜‰, then those pages will be useful as references for good values to uphold, but still might not seem very practical today. We currently live in a society with oppressive power structures, standardized curriculum without standardized resources, and where information is not considered a free and human right. So in the meantime, I urge you to politically support improving public education but consider alternative schools that promote student autonomy (via self guided, self paced learning that focuses on mastery rather than grades). That said, there are various schools of thought (hah) on alternative learning institutions, and you should definitely look into ones that align with your personal values. My wife and I have personally have started sending our son to a local Montessori.

Regardless of what school your child is in, I recommend supplementing with self paced interactive learning systems online that focus on mastery rather than grades, like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) or [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/), can help instead. MIT [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) is also an invaluable resource of learning materials.

## What Should be Taught

I'm a big believer in the idea that [Objectivity](/garden/objectivity/index.md) is a myth. That there typically isn't one objective truth, but that essentially everything is a social construct and believing there's only one truth allows knowledge to be used as a tool of oppression. Different cultures having different knowledge stemming from their different experiences, needs, and values  can then become a _strength_ rather than something to standardize away. That also means its not worth talking about avoiding "dogma" and "politics" in courses, because doing so obscures the fact that _everything_ taught will be in some form political. So it's okay to talk about values you believe should be taught in schools, because if you don't, it'll default to the values of the status quo.

I should emphasize that the only value I definitely think should be for _sure_ spread by such an educational system is a rejection of any person's authority over another. Beyond that I don't want to lean into my own personal values being the correct ones or, indeed, that the concept of "correct values" even exists outside of perhaps a very small list (like the aforementioned importance of autonomy). I think a [Decentralized Education](/garden/decentralized-education/index.md) is the way to ensure that education can adapt over time and to local culture and values.

That said, values I would hope/expect to see importance placed upon, based on my current understanding of the world, would be promoting education, environmentalism, transformative justice, and respect for both one's self and others (and even animals!). I also think it's important to promote things to learn based upon their utility. I think this will help reinforce the idea that curiosity and learning are good things that should be leaned into rather than suppressed. I'd hope these values would also instill a value that one has agency to improve the world through direct action.

## Further Reading

There are some related schools of thought and theories of education I came across when looking into decentralized education that I didn't explore further because they seemed misaligned to other values and principles I was looking for. In case you'd like to look into them more, some of those concepts are:
- [Pedagogy of the Oppressed](https://envs.ucsc.edu/internships/internship-readings/freire-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed.pdf)
- [Siemens and Downes' Connectivism](https://learning-theories.com/connectivism-siemens-downes.html)
- [Zone of Proximal Development](https://www.simplypsychology.org/zone-of-proximal-development.html)

<span id="678ae488-979f-4774-a76c-f35bc0f1e2a9">I also found [Anarchism and Education](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/judith-suissa-anarchism-and-education) and have added it to my "To Be Read" list, but haven't yet found time to go through it. I suspect it goes in further detail on a lot of concepts I explore in this garden though.</span>
