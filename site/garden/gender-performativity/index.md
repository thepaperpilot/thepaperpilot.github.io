A [Gender](/garden/gender/index.md) theory by Judith Butler, as described in [Gender Trouble](https://www.amazon.com/Gender-Trouble-Feminism-Subversion-Routledge/dp/0415389550). Butler argues that we observe gender norms performed by others and reproduce them. In this way, gender is a force that acts upon us. Philosophy Tube describes this theory in more detail in [I read the most misunderstood philosopher in the world](https://youtu.be/QVilpxowsUQ)
