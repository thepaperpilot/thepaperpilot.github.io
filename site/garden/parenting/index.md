As leftists, my wife and I want to raise our son with certain values that buck the trend in modern (apolitical) discourse. Most significant of these values is autonomy: we believe our child has agency and, despite them being dependent on us for their survival, they do not deserve to be on the tail end of an authoritarian hierarchy of parent over child.

## Independence

<span id="6777f9e9-da40-42f7-9ac3-ab9c732be035">To clarify, I am _not_ saying our child must quickly learn to be independent and exist without aid from my wife and I. To the contrary, I believe its incredibly important for us, as caregivers, to be extremely supportive, nurturing, and of course caring. This may be considered "coddling" or "spoiling", but those are not serious concerns to a child's development. There's a book called [The Myth Of The Spoiled Child](https://www.alfiekohn.org/myth-spoiled-child/) that I want to read that apparently goes into details on why its _control_ that harms development, not indulgence.</span>

Being dependent is _not_ the same as imposing authority. It only becomes so when you leverage your help to control them. A guide dog is not imposing authority on the person they guide, and neither is providing unconditional food, water, shelter, and love.

### Autonomy

Autonomy, however, is something our son _will_ have. He has agency, and we're willing to do things like [Bed Sharing](/garden/bed-sharing/index.md)  when he refuses to sleep in the crib, and as he gets older we plan on reinforcing bodily autonomy by asking for consent before hugs, picking him up, etc. There's a natural curve to this though - before we can communicate with each other, it can be hard to resolve some of his protests.

And naturally, there are dangerous things I do not plan on letting our son do, especially ones that are present in the home like alcohol or VR. I plan on educating him on why those are particularly harmful for his age range.  On these issues and similar ones there should be a focus on providing relevant information and that if something _were_ to happen that he should come to us so we can help without judging. This is important because trying to keep our son ignorant or under constant control is simply not feasible, not ethical, and doesn't prepare him for life without us.

This view of children having autonomy is particularly relevant when it comes to my thoughts on [Education](/garden/education/index.md).

### Enforcing Rules

Respecting autonomy means not forcing someone else to do something against their will. There's levels to it, of course, and before I can properly communicate with out son I still need to change their diapers, regardless of their willingness. But a general framework for navigating situations of bad behavior is to go over the negative consequences of such behavior, be it potential harm to him or those around him, or social consequences of developing a negative reputation. Punishment is not a good deterrent, so we'll employ transformative justice, trying to resolve the underlying issue that caused the bad behavior. And if I can't explain the negative consequences of something, then honestly the validity of the rule should come into question. We believe this framework should allow us to navigate potentially tricky parenting situations in ways that maintain our sons' autonomy.

We'll also be teaching them about the context behind when certain behaviors are allowed. For instance, my wife and I curse at home and I don't expect that to change anytime soon, but I don't curse at work, and our son shouldn't curse at school. We'll discuss there being social expectations and therefore social consequences for doing things considered inappropriate within the given context.

In practice, this also forces us as the parents to think about rules critically and be able to argue for their existence, and consider situations where they can be broken. We would be leading by example. To use the classic anarchist meme as an example, I shouldn't just say its bedtime "because we say so". Instead I should rely on an argument, like that him feeling tired and that he'll feel better tomorrow once he's well rested, that there's nothing left to do today, that I'm going to sleep too, and I'm looking forward to reading him in bed.

Funnily enough, I do actually think there's a fair argument to be had that bedtime _is_ authoritarian, and I want to rely on arguments other than "you have school/work early tomorrow" because, yeah, those are institutions that _do_ start too early (although I think this may change, as experts are advocating for) and have an authoritarian hierarchy that prevents us from changing the starting time. I'm sympathetic to this argument, but at the moment we _are_ forced to participate in capitalism in order to survive, and that means needing to work around waking up early while we work towards a better society.

## Role of the Community

I believe parenting should be far more communal rather than our current [Neoliberal](/garden/neoliberalism/index.md) emphasis on parental responsibility. We used to have multi generational homes and closer knit [Local Communities](/garden/local-communities/index.md) , making raising a child a lot easier than when it's just a parent or two on their own. To a degree the child should be considered more of just another member of the community rather than explicitly their parents child. It's okay of course to be close to ones child, but focusing on ones lineage is similar to nationalism and can reinforce patriarchy and other power structures. It also exposed the children to more people, helping them foster pro social behavior. To that end, kids should be regularly interacting with and learning from all the people in their community, not just their parents and teachers. As they say, "it takes a village to raise a child".

## Technology

Technology is really important to our lives, and we don't believe it should be avoided just because some aspects of technology can be bad. We'll likely get our son a phone at a fairly young age for emergencies, and install some creative apps for things like music, drawing, or writing things down. Later on we'll encourage games that emphasize good skills, like puzzle games or sandbox games.

Our son watched hey bear as an infant to around the 6 months mark, where we transitioned to super simple songs, Ms Rachel, and Imogen Heap's Happy song. These all seem fairly high quality and our son enjoys them. We don't think these are harmful to development, although we avoid channels like Cocomelon that just feel too cheaply produced. The Montessori our son goes to also uses songs like the ones we use to keep children entertained. The only proper TV show we already know we'll be showing our son is Bluey, and probably modern Sesame Street, but we'll look for others as well.

As a general rule, we do _not_ want to just give our son access to YouTube kids, and really I'm against algorithmic feeds in general. I like that hey bear and super simple have livestreams and compilation videos that mean we don't have to worry about autoplay, because YT likes to try out these shitty low effort and often AI generated videos with a couple hundred views. I don't know why they think we'd want that based off watching super simple and the others, but it speaks to broader trends towards AI slop taking over these platforms. But in my experience other videos I watch - gaming, video essays, etc. - don't get AI slop in the recommendations and autoplay lists. I typically get a channel I need to specify "Don't Recommend Channel" for on every single video.

Following my stance against algorithmic feeds, social media will be avoided for quite a long time. Ultimately I don't want to alienate our son from his peers, and would rather rely on just educating positive and healthy social media use, though, so I'll be playing this issue by ear. I'd be sooner okay with something like discord than something like twitter due to the lack of algo feed.

## Further Reading

[No! Against Adult Supremacy](https://archive.org/details/no-against-adult-supremacy/page/n5/mode/2up) is a tome of various essays regarding the rights of children and specifically about abolishing the power dynamics between them and adults. It goes beyond parenting and talks about children and adults more generally.

A video essay called [Wife Swap, Supernanny & How We Discriminate Against Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySAP3d0Gh8U) also discusses adult supremacy and how media that portrays parenting reveal how our culture currently treats kids.
