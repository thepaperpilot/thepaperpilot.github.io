I'm a big fan of digital avatars, although I don't really have one for myself and I don't use the social apps where they'd be useful

Digital avatars can allow for experimenting with [Gender](/garden/gender/index.md) and self expression, or reflecting how people want to be perceived changing on a regular basis

[Dicebear](https://www.dicebear.com) is a cool collection of avatar creators, that can also be queried for random avatars

I also think the trend of using avatar models in many places is really cool. Like bitmoji or vtuber models.

I feel like I could find some form of avatar that more closely resembles me and my personality, but I'm not sure on the details.

You can find vtuber artists on [vtuber.gg](https://vtuber.gg). You can also look into things like [PNGTubing](https://reactive.fugi.tech/) that make vtuber models more accessible.
