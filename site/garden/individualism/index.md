Individualism is a [Neoliberal](/garden/neoliberalism/index.md) value system centered around independence and self sufficiency. It argues for taking care of oneself before others, and that it's wrong for people to be forced to take care of others before their selves, i.e. via wealth redistribution. This value system is antithetical to the [Anarchist](/garden/anarchism/index.md) values of community and mutual aid. I personally am against individualism and see it as against humans nature of cooperation. We're a social people and have for our entire existence relied upon each other.

As a personal anecdote, I'm a recent parent and the whole "it takes a village" adage makes a lot of sense, and has made me hyper aware of how individualism has made it very hard to raise a kid these days. Even kids are seen as free loaders, and are encouraged to move out after high school. That means there's no longer 3+ generations living in a house anymore, contributing to urban sprawl and making [Parenting](/garden/parenting/index.md) rely more difficult for couples who have a weaker support network (since help us now a drive away rather than living with them). Suburbs are spread out and isolating, preventing strong [Local Communities](/garden/local-communities/index.md) from forming. To sum up, the "village" doesn't exist anymore.

Hyper individualism is a modern invention, not a "good ole traditional value" we should all aspire to. It was explicitly created by capitalist values, and replaced pre-existing value systems that prioritized co-operation.

## Individuality

Just to clarify something because the names are similar, but individualism is NOT about individuality. Individualism is about responsibility and independence. Individuality is anti-conformity, which is funny because individualism is pretty closely associated with right wingers who, in my experience, are very much pro-conformity.
