## AAA games

Cost a lot of money to make, mostly due to the graphics arms race

The price required to make games that expensive earn the cost back would be much higher than the current price of AAA games

Graphics would not justify those higher prices, and AAA studios know this

Techniques AAA games use to make more money without raising the base price:
- Premium Editions
- [MTX](/garden/mtx/index.md)
- [Pre-Order Bonuses](/garden/pre-order-bonuses/index.md)

## Free-to-play games

Typically utilize [MTX](/garden/mtx/index.md) and ads in order to profit

## Indie developers

Trying to make a sustainable living is hard

The industry is packed with lots of competition

I don't blame them for their monetization

## Ethical game monetization

Requirements:
- Free demo
- Paid base game
- No MTX
- Paid content expansions
