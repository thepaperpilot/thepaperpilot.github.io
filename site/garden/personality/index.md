I believe our personality is deeply tied with our [Identity](/garden/identity/index.md) - we categorize ourselves into different groups (which together compose our identity), and then act accordingly to how we perceive members of that category to act. In essence, we wish to "fit in" with the members of the groups we identify with.

In this way every group has a sort of socially defined "archetype" or "prototype" that acts upon members of that group. They internalize these archetypes as heuristics or scripts for behavior. This is related to the social identity theory and self-categorization theory of personality.

Neurologies are a notable exceptions, as an influence upon your personality that _is_ part of your essence rather than dependent on your social context. Humans have neurodiversity; we do, fundamentally, think in ways that are unique to us. Exactly how that manifests will naturally still be dependent on our environment, but there is definitely some degree of "nature" to our personality.

## Individuality

To clarify, this isn't to say we don't have unique personalities or that members of certain groups tend to all look or act the same, but rather that we all experience forces on our personality based on those groups. Some of these forces are stronger than others. It's a way of saying we are a product of our environment and that nurture is stronger than nature. It's an acceptance of [Materialism](/garden/materialism/index.md) over idealism.

[This article](https://archive.rushkoff.com/articles/how-cultivating-awe-can-save-the-world.html) over collectivist thinking put it this way:

> To the current, individualist mindset, such connection sounds frightening: it seems like a diminishment of oneâ€™s individuality and freedom. Awe, intimacy, and group consciousness seem to compromise self-sovereignty and claims to ownership (IP!). In actuality, awe opens us to the fuller realization that our individual and collective identities are mutually reinforcing. Instead of embracing awe, however, the frightened individual panics. We build walls instead of tearing them down.
