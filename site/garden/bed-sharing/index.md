As new parents we were pressured into restless nights where after getting our son to sleep, we'd try placing him in his bassinet only to wake him in the process and have to start the soothing over. This is an incredibly common experience for new parents in the US due to the [AAP's recommendations](https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/20619/New-safe-sleep-recommendations-can-help) and nurses being required to endorse it. The typical advice on preventing this is to train the baby to sleep by ignoring their cries for hours each night until they learn we won't come to help. But to us and many others this sounds like a horrible lesson to teach your child, and we'd much prefer our babies know they can rely on us to help them when they're distressed.

Nurses would regularly bring up and warm against the alternative - bed sharing - despite it being normalized outside the US and [even common in the US](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5769799/). The risk is mostly due to sleeping in an armchair or on a sofa with your baby, due to the soft surfaces, or with hazards like pillows - that's where the 67x greater risk number comes from. However, most bed sharing occurs in a bed (and in fact, there's articles like [this one](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bed-sharing-safer-infants_l_63442e2ce4b08e0e607b272a) where they had an incident of falling asleep in an armchair specifically because of the issues sleeping they had before they bed shared), and there are studies like the ones analyzed in [this article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9792691/) that show the chance of SIDS may even go _down_ when bed sharing without hazards, particularly with breast fed infants.

You can find countless stories of parents who saw the AAP recommendations against bed sharing (or heard the recommendations echoed by their nurses) and promised to avoid it... only to find themselves unable to reliably sleep for months on end, until they eventually cave and have their best sleep since pre-parenthood! Many parents have started bed sharing for explicitly this reason, beyond just us.

Just as a bit of a disclaimer, don't solely take advice on caring for your infant from strangers on the internet. But if you choose to bed share, know you're not alone and don't let the nurses shame you for it. You have enough going on without that distress. Do look up how to bed share safely before doing so. What worked for us was the cuddle curl position during infancy, and just sleeping between us around the one year mark. Of course, in both cases we would ensure the space is clear of any hazards. Also, we formula fed but studies indicate breastfeeding would further reduce the chance of SIDS, regardless of where your baby sleeps.
