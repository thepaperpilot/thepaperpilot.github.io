Materialism is the idea that one's environment shapes one's thoughts. Under this argument, the way to shape public opinion is by changing the environment. For example, a materialist would argue that humans are not naturally greedy (as is evidenced by many years of history before capitalism was introduced), but rather capitalism incentivized greed and has so thoroughly taken over our environment that everyone has become greedier. This also leads to the argument in favor of [Police Abolition](/garden/police-abolition/index.md) that crime can be reduced by improving people's material conditions, without the need for state sanctioned violence.

[Apoliticism](/garden/apoliticism/index.md) leading to implicit support of the status quo is an example of materialism in action.
