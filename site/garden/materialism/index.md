Materialism is the idea that one's environment shapes one's thoughts. Under this argument, the way to shape public opinion is by changing the environment. For example, a materialist would argue that humans are not naturally greedy (as is evidenced by many years of history before capitalism was introduced), but rather capitalism incentivized greed and has so thoroughly taken over our environment that everyone has become greedier. This also leads to the argument in favor of [Police Abolition](/garden/police-abolition/index.md) that crime can be reduced by improving people's material conditions, without the need for state sanctioned violence.

[Anarchism](/garden/anarchism/index.md) and Communism are both materialist ideologies. Fascism is the opposite: an [Idealist](/garden/idealism/index.md) ideology.

[Apoliticism](/garden/apoliticism/index.md) leading to implicit support of the status quo is an example of materialism in action.

I should mention that, while I do consider myself a materialist (again, anarchism is a materialist ideology), I'm not quite as dogmatic about it as some MLs. Marx used materialism to describe certain "superstructures", which would include things like race and gender, which are shaped by the economic mode of production and in turn reinforce and legitimize that mode of production. I think race and gender are more aptly described as their own distinct material relations, and won't be solved on their own once merely be adopting socialism.
