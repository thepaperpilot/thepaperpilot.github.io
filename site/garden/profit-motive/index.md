Profit motive refers to how, under capitalism, power and influence will naturally trend towards consolidation in an ever decreasing number of hands. This is not a claim that under capitalism are naturally more greedy and profit seeking (although [Materialism](/garden/materialism/index.md) would argue that is, in fact, the case), but rather that the structure of Capitalism will incentivize and therefore inevitably trend towards that consolidation.

The profit motive is also what prevents society from properly taking care of each other and the planet, because profits come first. Saving the environment will necessarily entail abolishing the profit motive by eradicating capitalism.
