Solidarity is one's sense of being part of a group that mutually cares for each other. It means acting according to the interests of the group rather than just yourself. Essentially, it's the opposite of [Individualism](/garden/individualism/index.md). Rather than acting solely in your own self interest, solidarity teaches that you can strengthen the network that will, in turn, support you.

You are already a member of many such groups, even if you don't currently have solidarity with those groups.

Solidarity is a skill that can be practiced and trained. This is something one should strive to do, in order to combat the capitalist and individualist programming we've grown up with.

Solidarity is an ongoing commitment to building networks of care and resistance. The more we practice it, the less we have to rely on institutions that donâ€™t have our best interests at heart. I believe this is the most important thing we can be doing today to ensure positive change tomorrow - be it via further direct action or electoralism.

## Practicing solidarity

Solidarity can be practiced via collective action in many aspects of our daily life, and are not mutually exclusive.

As a worker, you can go on strikes, form unions, and participate within that union to bargain collectively.

As a consumer, you can participate in [Consumer Boycotts](/garden/consumer-boycotts/index.md) and shop at places that share your values, such as worker's cooperatives.

As a community member you can volunteer at your local library, attend HOA and city council meetings, and help organize local projects like community gardens or a [Mutual Aid](/garden/mutual-aid/index.md) network. Going to protests also falls under this category.

As a home buyer, buy your home through a housing co-op where you can get cheaper prices through collective bargaining.

As a small business owner, make your business a co-op and/or do business with other local co-ops.

As someone who eats food, try to buy from farmers markets and food co-ops.

You can participate in any and as many of these ways, or others. The main focus is to help you and those around you realize they can rely on others and together we can all make it better than each of us on our own. Your community and the projects within it are more reliable and resilient than centralized programs that can be taken away on the whim of, say, the president.

Above all, solidarity is about being present within a group. So the best thing you can do is organize - join an org or start one. Personally, I think [starting a computer club](https://startacomputer.club/) is a good idea.
