Mutual aid is an economic mode that is compatible and associated with [Anarchism](/garden/anarchism/index.md). It is essentially a gift economy, where people gift things to each other under the mutual understanding that together, everyone will be taken care of. It essentially argues against the idea that we need extrinsic [Motivation](/garden/motivation/index.md) in order to help ourselves and society.

Individual gifts would not be tallied and scored against, but individuals will naturally form reputations that'll likely dictate how many or how nice of gifts they receive. In addition to how much you give, this reputation would be affected by attitude and how acceptable your behavior is. Essentially, [Free Association](/garden/free-association/index.md) works together with mutual aid to enforce pro-social behavior.

Services could be gifts as well, including performing a single step in a large coordinated process to produce goods. You don't have to hand people physical items to be in good standing.

Anarchists tend to believe in sustainable living and not living in excess. Mutual aid would be how people get rid of that excess, and in theory people who receive many gifts will pass them along, or their reputation as a hoarder may limit future gifts naturally.

Historically, even people who are deemed to be slacking on their own contributions will at least be gifted the necessities to continue living. The cost is negligible enough and our sense of humanity great enough to ensure people don't die preventably. If there is resource scarcity, it's naturally the slackers who would feel the strain first (unless its due to a justifiable reason, such as a disability), thus encouraging them to participate. But, due to technology, productivity is at an all time high and it wouldn't take much to sustain the population even with slackers.

You can use [Mutual aid hub](https://www.mutualaidhub.org/) to contribute to or use mutual aid networks that exist today.

While associated with anarchism, communism in any form would likely involve mutual aid. It's the epitome of Marx' famous slogan "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".
