Mutual aid is a form of [Direct Action](/garden/direct-action/index.md) where [Local Communities](/garden/local-communities/index.md) form networks of gift givers, strengthening that community. Rather than using currency or bartering, people offer and request gifts, under the mutual understanding that everyone will be supported. It practices [Solidarity](/garden/solidarity/index.md) and is a form of gift economy, which has significant historical precedent. Societies can and have survived and thrived solely on gift economies, with bartering only happening between groups, not within them. Mutual aid is essentially proof we don't need currency nor any form of tracking credits and debts in order for people to feel [Motivation](/garden/motivation/index.md) to help those around them.

Mutual aid is not charity. Charity requires and attempts to justify a hierarchy of the rich going to the poor. Mutual aid, on the other hand, suggests a society where resources are distributed such that everyone lives in abundance yet none in excess. Without the [Profit Motive](/garden/profit-motive/index.md), this form of resource distribution would also be notably more sustainable than our current form under capitalism.

Mutual aid can and does exist today, as an alternative to and undermining capitalism. In practice, I've found a lot of orgs that identify as mutual aid networks today are much closer to charity organizations, but I think the ideals of mutual aid are simply difficult to implement in a society with oppressed and marginalized groups. With that in mind, helping charity orgs "in the name of" mutual aid can still genuinely help people and perhaps still spread the values of mutual aid and leftism in general. You can find such organizations on [Mutual aid hub](https://www.mutualaidhub.org/).

## Mutual Aid in Post-Capitalism

Individual gifts would not be tallied and scored against, but individuals will naturally form reputations that'll likely dictate how many or how nice of gifts they receive. In addition to how much you give, this reputation would be affected by attitude and how acceptable your behavior is. Essentially, [Free Association](/garden/free-association/index.md) works together with mutual aid to enforce pro-social behavior without the need for state violence.

Services could be gifts as well, including performing a single step in a large coordinated process such as running a factory. You don't have to hand people physical items to be in good standing.

Mutual aid would be how people get rid of excess by removing the profit motive and encouraging those with excess to pass it along, or their reputation as a hoarder may limit future gifts naturally.

Historically, people who are not in good standing, such as not contributing, will still at least be gifted the necessities to continue living. The cost is negligible enough and our sense of humanity great enough to ensure people don't die preventably. Due to technology and productivity being at an all time high, the entire population can trivially be sustained even with some portion of it being unable or unwilling to contribute.

While particularly associated with [Anarchism](/garden/anarchism/index.md), communism in any form would likely involve mutual aid. It's the epitome of Marx' famous slogan "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".
