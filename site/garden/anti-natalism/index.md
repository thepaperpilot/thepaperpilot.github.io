The belief people shouldn't have babies and see it as unethical. Often rooted in environmentalism, or the belief being born is a non consensual act (and that consent shouldn't be assumed, because existence is painful). It's a branch of nihilism.

I personally think anti natalism is a harmful viewpoint, and that a society can be achieved without suffering and with a positive impact on the environment, like any other species.

Buddha also believed life is suffering and that people should strive to free themselves from the cycle of rebirth, but he was not an anti natalist and did not see anti natalism as a pathway to global enlightenment.

While I disagree with the idea we should be promoting anti natalism, I of course respect any person's decision to not have children for whatever reason. Forced pregnancy and birth would be ridiculous. Anti natalists will fight for abortion rights and contraceptive rights, which are good causes, and for people to adopt instead of give birth, which is a good idea in today's society. I think as we approach a society that is more just and equal for all, the amount of kids born that need to be adopted will go down eventually to 0 anyways.
