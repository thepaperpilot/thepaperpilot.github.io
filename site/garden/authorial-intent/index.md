Authorial intent is the meaning an artist tries to imbue into their work. It is, arguably, what makes art art. The act of assembling a piece with intent is what turns a group of materials into art. Even a normal, unnotable, and untouched scene can be turned into art merely by an artist intentionally capturing it in a photograph.

Many postmodernist works challenge this idea, pushing it to its limits, by dismantling traditional expectations of what art is and leaving authorial intent as the only recognizable "artistic" element - such as [4'33"](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1386) or [White Painting](https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/40/639) that offer environments for interpretation rather than content itself.

However, while authorial intent may define the act of creating art, it doesnâ€™t actually define the art's meaning. That's because of a concept called the death of the author.

## The Death of the Author

The death of the author is an argument that posits that meaning is created by the reader, not the author. That the authorial intent is inaccessible within the author's mind, and all we will ever have is our own interpretation of the work and the meaning we create from it.

It means art can take on meanings beyond the author's original intent, and potentially even in direct contradiction with the authorial intent. This happens when, for example, works can be interpreted as trans allegories despite the author not intending for that to be the case. This naturally arises from the reader relating to the struggle of a character within the story, and finding it matches up with their own. Famously, this has happened with trans positive readings of Harry Potter, despite the views of its author J.K. Rowling.

Knowledge of how others interpret a work may "lock you in" to that interpretation and make it more difficult to form a new one. The mere knowledge of what themes are at play, the context surrounding how the piece was made, and of course your own experiences prior to consuming the work all play a part in your experience and interpretation of it. Beyond just art, this is something prudent to keep in mind when reading things like news articles, which can be interpreted and essentially distorted merely due to our pre existing biases.

I'm quite supportive of the death of the author, and it aligns well with my views on [Constructionism](/garden/constructivism/index.md). Essentially I believe knowledge, or in this case meaning, is not transferred passively from a teacher/artist but rather is fully dependent on an active student/interpreter, who adapts their mental model as it is challenged by these new experiences, gaining nuance but always remaining an imperfect reproduction of what they experienced.

## Further Reading

I can't discuss the death of the author without mentioning [The Beginner's Guide](/garden/the-beginner-s-guide/index.md). If this topic at all interests you, I strongly urge you to play it without looking up anything about it. Afterwards, that page links to several analyses I also recommend.
