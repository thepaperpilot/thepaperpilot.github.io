[Nostr](https://nostr.com/) is the largest currently existing example of a fully [Decentralized Social Media](/garden/decentralized-social-media/index.md) . It fixes the pick a server problem the [Fediverse](/garden/fediverse/index.md) has with a properly [Decentralized Identity](/garden/decentralized-identity/index.md) .

Unfortunately, the network has a culture problem - its been primarily built by and caters to the cryptocurrency community and alt right. It'll be difficult to gain broad adoption as anyone using the platform will have to take care to explain how they're using nostr but aren't alt right.
