To preface, I want children to be safe and secure and protected against those who wish them harm physically or psychologically. However, I think the puritanical approach of making every digital space blocked off to those over 13, and not allowing nearly any form of communication to occur in spaces where under 13s are allowed (such as YT kids), ultimately harms kids and pushes them to lie about their age and make their way into potentially unsafe regions of the internet anyways.

What we need instead are better ways of teaching children how to safely navigate media and social media, think critically and question systems, and have online spaces where they can be a kid - like the Webkinzes and Club Penguins of yesteryear.

These spaces should naturally still have parental supervision, and focus on teaching kids about the potential dangers and generally how to navigate various online interactions. However, I don't want to lean into adult supremacy (or at least parental supremacy) and make kids give up their autonomy and privacy. I think this is especially important with respect to institutions and phobias that parents may be trying to reinforce, that kids can learn to think critically about, like their identity.
