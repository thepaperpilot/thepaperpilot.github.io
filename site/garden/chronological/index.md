# Chronological

A collection of information that is tied to its creation or edit date

Part of the [Freeform vs Chronological Dichotomy](/garden/freeform-vs-chronological-dichotomy/index.md)

Anything with a "timeline" or "feed" is considered chronological
- Even if there's algorithmic sortings that take things other than creation or edit date into account!

Chronological displays are less suitable as stores of knowledge ([Digital Gardens](/garden/digital-gardens/index.md))

Social media overuses timelines and feeds

RSS feeds work really well with this form of content
