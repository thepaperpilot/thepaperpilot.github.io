# This Knowledge Hub

> Referenced by: [Digital Gardens](/garden/digital-gardens/index.md)

This is my knowledge hub!
- It's a [Digital Garden](/garden/digital-gardens/index.md) collecting my thoughts in varying levels of completeness on basically anything I have interest in

This is not Wikipedia. My thoughts are biased and argumentative, but to the best of my ability based on fact and expertise

<span id="6637b86a-3603-45ef-a21e-b33c7d96c529">I'm writing on _something_ essentially every day</span>
- Most of my pages are private, especially the journal pages
- I'll only push updates to this site every so often (not an automatic process)

Written in [Logseq](/garden/logseq/index.md) and rendered with [Vitepress](/garden/vitepress/index.md)
