# Game Dev Tree

> Tags: [My Projects](/garden/my-projects/index.md)

Play it [here](https://thepaperpilot.org/gamedevtree)!

My first (good) incremental game! (My actual first was [Shape Tycoon](https://thepaperpilot.itch.io/shape-tycoon) - I don't recommend it!)

It's [Open Source](/garden/open-source/index.md)!

The [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGameDevTree) page on this game mentions some of the cool things about this game
