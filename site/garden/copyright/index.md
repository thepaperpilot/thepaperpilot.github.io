Copyright is a neoliberal invention designed to ensure corporations can continue making money off the work of individuals. Individuals also support it, but that has more to do with living under a capitalist system where their art is their livelihood. Without the [Profit Motive](/garden/profit-motive/index.md) , there'd be no need to restrain what people can do with art.

_However_, I feel personally conflicted by the above typical anti-capitalist stance on copyright, because I think there's more to it than just protecting financial interests. I think art contains a little bit of the artist, and it's natural for them to feel protective of it. Ultimately, if an artist gives you some art with conditions attached, I think respecting that and not straying outside of what you've been given consent to do makes sense.

Technology has, throughout history, made certain forms of art easier and made things like remixing other people's art easier as well. We have memes, photoshops, synths, and samples that all take works from other people and make something new from it. I think this is a wonderful expression of creativity and how a lot of culture is created and spread, and I don't want to see this process restricted. Ultimately, even though I think consent is incredibly important, I don't think many people will stop remixing things regardless of the original artists' consent.

Today, copyright law has a least given us a period of time at which the artist no longer has control over their work and it enters the creative commons. I like that system, and even in a society without a state, I suspect people will generally form an understanding of there being a point at which an artist loses control over their art (likely after their death).

Generative AI is another form of remixing that has been very controversial amongst artists. I don't think it all stems from concern over their livelihoods being taken away, although that's certainly part of it. Even in a society where everyone's needs are met, I believe some people will want to disallow their art from being used in training generative AI models.

Ultimately, I think exactly what will be considered okay will change over time, I suspect trending towards allowing people to do whatever they want with art. While we're under capitalism I think its important to fight for individual artists but not for corporations. Making art go into the creative commons at time of death is a reasonable line in my opinion. After capitalism is abolished, I think we'll need to rely on [Free Association](/garden/free-association/index.md) to effectively determine what is considered okay, which will naturally handle people's differing views in regards to when the artist loses control and what forms of remixing are okay to restrict. Free association would also adapt live to changing societal values, so if I'm correct that over time people will care less about restricting how art is used, free association will naturally reflect that.

I don't really consider myself an artist, but I personally already don't want to place many restrictions on my works - be it this writing, the code I write, or other works. I'm pretty happy with the terms of the CC-BY-NC-SA license I've chosen for this website.
