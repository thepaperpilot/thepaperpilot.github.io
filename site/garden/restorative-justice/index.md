Restorative justice is an alternative to punitive justice that focuses on reconnecting the person who did the crime with their community. It recognizes the role of alienation in causing crime and seeks to undo that alienation. This is useful for crimes that happen independent of material conditions, meaning [Transformative Justice](/garden/transformative-justice/index.md) won't suffice. This includes things like crimes of passion.

This typically involves some sort of mediation process, involving those close to both the perpetrator and the victim. The process could be as simple as hearing everyone out and coming to a mutual understanding of what happened and of each other, apologies exchanged, and society continues. This could also involve something like the perpetrator agreeing to reparations of some sort, to help undo or mitigate the harm done. It could involve the perpetrator seeking mental health help, such as voluntarily checking into a mental health institution. The point here is that the goal is on helping undo the damage and restoring the perpetrators connection with their community - not punishment.
