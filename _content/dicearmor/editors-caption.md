Many of the objects I've created, I've made scriptable objects so that game designers can add and modify them easily. Additionally I would create custom inspectors for the objects to help make them as easy to understand and edit as possible. The opponents' artifical intelligence is made up of many strategies, in a prioritized list. When its the opponents' turn they go through each strategy and check if they can be run, and if so then the opponent performs the strategy then starts back over at the top of the list of strategies. The + sign under the list of strategies opens an organized dropdown of all the various strategies.
