The dice shop is dynamically populated by a list of dice available to the player, which can be changed during cutscenes, and is checked against the dice owned by the player to generate sold out indicators. On the left the player can choose to filter the options down to a single dice effect, which also updates the "Buy All" button to buy only all the dice in the current filter.
