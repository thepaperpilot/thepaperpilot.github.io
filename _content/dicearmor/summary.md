title: Dice Armor Summary
---
Dice Armor is a game being developed by a team of nine including a producer, a creative director, a narrative writer, an artist, two programmers, and 3 game designers. The information here is about our most recent build, created after nine weeks of development of 15. My role is the lead programmer, doing everything from interface coding, editor scripts, integrating Babble Buds, and of course everything related to the gameplay itself. 

Dice Armor is a dice dueling game. Players can use abilities, flip dice, and attack each other to win in a dice game that puts chance into the hands of the players. The game comes with a full campaign (only the first chapter is currently implemented, but we are on schedule to have the entire story included in the final build), using my own Babble Buds engine for the cutscenes. It is also the first project to use Babble Movie Maker to create those cutscenes. 

Because this game is still in development, there are some buttons present to make the game easier to test that won't be in the final build: You start with all the dice in the game already in the shop, there's a button to give yourself free money to buy these dice with, and in the duel there are buttons to force a win or a loss, which can be used to skip the tutorial (not recommended for first time players).
