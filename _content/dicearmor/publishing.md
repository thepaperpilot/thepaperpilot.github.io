title: Dice Armor Publishing
---
After the end of the semester, Dice Armor will be published for windows, mac, and linux app on itch.io as well as a mobile app on the Google Play store and iOS app store. The game has been developed with flexible resolutions and aspect ratios in mind. Monetization strategies and whether or not to make the code open source is not yet determined. There will be a web demo hosted online here, but it is missing some features and may have some graphical glitches not present in the downloaded versions of the game (gameplay and story should be unaffected), and may have perfomance issues. It is recommended to download the version made for your preferred platform.
