When a cutscene ends, its final command is to either start a duel or set the next cutscene in the story. In the latter case there is an additional field for what to call the next cutscene, and what location it takes place at. The cutscene is then added to the player's save file, and when they visit the city locations are greyed out until they have at least one action to do there. Each location has a dynamically populated action wheel with custom range of acceptable angles.
