Dice Armor is a dice dueling game. Players can use abilities, flip dice, and attack each other to win in a dice game that puts chance into the hands of the players. This is what the dueling scene looks like, with a tutorial cutscene happening on top to guide the player through the basics.
Also, all the dice are constructed dynamically, using quaternion math to figure out the placement of each component relative to the face its going on. The die in the middle has one of the player and opponents' portraits on each of its sides.
