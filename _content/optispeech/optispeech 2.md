The program is being updated by a team in the UT Dallas Speech Production Lab led by Anthony Lawn, so the program uses a more modern version of Unity, has an easier to use interface, can more easily support new features, and can connect to additional EMA systems, namely the Carstens AG501.

In addition, the program now includes documentation and unit tests to improve program stability and maintainability going forward.
