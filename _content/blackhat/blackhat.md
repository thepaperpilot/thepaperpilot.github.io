A game about an 80s blackhat hacker who plans and executes feats of social engineering to take down the largest conglomerate business in history.

## Concept

The player uses their trusty computer to surveil a corporation controlling everything in society from their food to their entertainment to their government. With knowledge in hand they proceed to plan an adventure-style mission to social engineer themselves into the corporation and take it down from the inside. Missions have no failure state and the outcomes of each mission guide the rest of the game and its story towards one of many endings. 

## Gameplay

Use a terminal to get money or perform surveillance on big bad enemy (a corporation). With this information you plan missions against the corporation. While still at home you switch between various applications (a terminal, web browser, IRC, and a notepad) the latter of which lists the knowledge you've discovered as well as your decisions on how to take out the heist. As you discover more information more options can become available to you. Once you lock in your decisions a cutscene plays, with your chosen options directing the scene and its outcome. The mission will have some amount of success that affects the rest of the missions (and can cause characters to recur or become suspicious or other things). Note that "failing" a mission does NOT end the game, just gives the player a different story than if they had succeeded. The final ending is determined by the success of the last mission, with some potential flavor text determined by extreme success/failure in previous missions. Each ending should feel complete, and conclusive. Indeed, the whole game should have a sense of ambiguity to the point where it isn't even clear what endings are "good" or "bad".

Certain interactions while researching (such as talking on IRC) may also influence how the missions will go. These are not decisions you make while planning, but rather consequences incurred whilst in the planning stage. 

## Aesthetic

The game will take place in the 80s, with dark or faded colors, especially faded gold. A good reference point would be the [Halt and Catch Fire](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=halt+and+catch+fire+scene) or, to a lesser extent, [Mr.Robot](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=mr+robot+scene) aesthetic. Try to include references to [1980s hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computer_security_hacker_history#1980s) or other things that make it feel more authentically 80s.

The atmosphere is filled with ambiguity and paranoia. Worries about making too big a splash as just a kid. Gets threats from people on IRC, maybe on one day before going to a mission someone comes to his house looking for him, etc. 

## Characters

The main character is a teenager just realizing the state of the society he's in, and decided to do something about it (like the protagonist from (recent young adult movie)). Take inspiration from [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange), [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), or maybe even [Kim Dotcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Dotcom) (do note I'm not saying those were good people or that this protagonist is either).
