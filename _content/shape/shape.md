title: Shape Tycoon

Shape Tycoon is a game where you play as a shape that can shift between several geometric objects in order to entertain an audience. Try to become so popular the entire world is your audience!

Each of your shapes has an attention meter, and you need to shift so that it never gets too low, or else you'll start losing audience members. Audience members generate revenue for you to augment your shapes to help you grow and expand your audience.

It runs in the browser so anyone can play it, but I recommend the desktop version as it'll run smoother and can probably be resized and stuff.

This game was made using the LibGDX engine, by badlogic games. It's a java game, but uses GWT to make the web version.
