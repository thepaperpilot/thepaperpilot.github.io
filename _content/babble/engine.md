### Engine

The engine originally made to make the Babble Buds program was separated out into its own engine called [babble.js](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/babble.js), so that projects created in Babble Buds can be used in other projects. For example, a game can create puppets in Babble Buds and then use them for cutscenes or player agency inside of the game. Additionally, it has been ported to C# (called [babble.cs](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/babble.cs)) for use with Unity, for the same kinds of purposes. You can check out [Tower Offense](/toweroffense) for a pixi.js game using Babble Buds puppets for the cutscenes, or [Dice Armor](/dicearmor) for a unity game using Babble Buds puppets for the cutscenes.
