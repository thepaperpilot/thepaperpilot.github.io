### Babble Movie Maker

Babble Movie Maker is a cutscene editor for Babble Buds puppets. You open a babble buds project in it, and you can add actors to a stage and have them move and change expressions, etc., on a timeline. You can then use the cutscene in a game using babble.js or babble.cs, or export the cutscene into a video file. There is even support for defining custom commands with custom fields, so that if you've extended on the default actions provided in babble.js or babble.cs, you can still use Movie Maker to create your cutscenes.
