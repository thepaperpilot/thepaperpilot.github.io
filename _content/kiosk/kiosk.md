title: Computer Science Kiosk
---
This is an open source program for a kiosk that will teach students the basics of computer science. It was initiated as a part of Anthony Lawnâ€™s Eagle Scout Project, which was to build such a kiosk to place in the Quail Valley Middle School library.

The kiosk uses Scratch as a teaching tool for students, and provides resources such as code.org that help interested students pursue Computer Science.
