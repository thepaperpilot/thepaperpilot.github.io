title: Slime Chargers!
---
A rare crystal has emerged, and you've taken your flying fortress to obtain it. Unfortunately, you'll first need to charge it up, before you can remove it. To do so you'll use a special breed of slimes that can charge these crystals through contact. Use your fortress to protect your slimes as they charge up your crystals!
