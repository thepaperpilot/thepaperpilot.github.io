title: One Click Man
---
A small game made for the one button jam that explores the idea of being able to defeat any opponent in a single click. Made for the One Button Jam 2016 in under a week.

Unfortunately it was a busy week and I didn't get much done past the moving camera and 2-D objects in 3-D space. That is to say, the graphics and story didn't get much attention. Sorry.
