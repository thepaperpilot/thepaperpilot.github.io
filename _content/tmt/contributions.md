title: TMT Contributions

In addition to many bug fixes and providing support to various mod creators on [the TMT discord](https://discord.gg/F3xveHV), I've directly contributed to the project by updating documentation, improving the discord link displays, and implementing the "lore" feature. I've additionally made several other tweaks that don't necessarily fit all TMT projects so they aren't present in the project itself, but appear as references in the source code for The Game Dev Tree.
