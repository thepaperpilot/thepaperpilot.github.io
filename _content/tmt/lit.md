During the Incremental Game Jam 2021 I wanted to use TMT to make a new game, and get a little more experimental with it, so here's a mod with no tree and an even bigger focus on player choice and strategy. Relatively short, but very fun! Check my discord for guides if you get stuck.

If you'd like even more content, try a mod made by a user called loader3229 that extends the gameplay up to 200 light: [Lit+](https://qq1010903229.github.io/lit/). It does an amazing job at staying true to the spirit of the original, and even fixes a couple bugs I never did due to the game jam ending.
