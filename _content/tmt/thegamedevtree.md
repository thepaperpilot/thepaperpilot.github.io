title: The Game Dev Tree

I personally felt like the original game could've benefited from keeping earlier layers relevant for longer, and if layers resetting was along the branches rather than entire rows. To help test the modding framework, I made my own mod called The Game Dev Tree, that uses those concepts as a core foundation for its game design. It also became a bit of a playground to implement new ideas for TMT in a live game so I could receive feedback from players.
