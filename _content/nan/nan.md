A game made in 48 hours for the 3rd Annual Chillenium at Texas A&M University. It was made by Anthony Lawn and Grant Barbee. The theme was "foofaraw", which basically means to make a big deal about nothing. 

This is the story of an adventurer named NaN, known across the land for his unwavering enthusiasm for helping anyone with anything. The story follows his fall following a lack of need for adventurers and the resulting menial task performing lifestyle. 

Mechanically, the game is about throwing stuff at other stuff. There's no UI becaue only lame games have those, and there's a lot of organic humor created from various objects having physics properties and being grabbable and such.
