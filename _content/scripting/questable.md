The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how to create a game where you use raycasts and projectiles to make guns, and nav meshes for basic AI. 

**Controls:**

Move - WASD
Aim - Mouse
Fire Bullets - Left Mouse Button
Quit - Escape
Restart - Backspace

After obtaining the paint gun...

Fire Paint - Right Mouse Button
Crouch - Control
Climb paint - Control near paint on a vertical surface

**How to Play:**

Move from room to room until you reach the end. Each room will introduce a new enemy or mechanic. 

Also, it's like really easy. I didn't spend much time on level design because I didn't have much time to work on this project this time around, so I really needed to focus on scripting this time. 

I think my ideas of the paint gun were a bit too grand considering all the other stuff I had going on these 3 weeks. Sorry about that, there won't be things like it detecting the edges of surfaces. And again, I didn't really have time to make any levels that really used the mechanic, but it's scripted and that's the part that matters.
