The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how to create a game where you use Unity's physics system to control a ball, with enemies and pickups and jump pads, etc. 

**Controls:**

In the level selection,

- Arrow keys to switch level
- Enter to select level
- Escape to quit game

In the game,

- Mouse to look, WASD to move
- Try to reach the green "finish" platform as quickly as possible, without dying
- Red objects are hazards
- Blue powerups increase your speed
- Red powerups make you smaller and lighter
- Yellow pickups reduce your time taken
- Green arrows make you jump
- Blue platforms slow you down
- Backspace to restart the level
- Escape to return to level select
