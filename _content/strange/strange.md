title: 12 is Strange

This is a game made in under 48 hours for UT Dallas' SDGA Fall 2015 Game Jam!

Now that the jam is over, the plot, characters, and puzzles will be modified and expanded upon, potentially leaving the original theme of "12". So, there will be a downloadable of the "Game Jam version" for those that wish, but the official version will be the one playing in the browser.
