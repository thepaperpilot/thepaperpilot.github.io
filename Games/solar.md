# Solar TD!

**[Store Page](http://thepaperpilot.itch.io/solar-td)**
**[Source Code](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/SolarTD)**

This was made in about a month for the LibGDX game jam!

The game takes a lot of inspiration from Onslaught TD, an old flash game. Now its in HTML5 and in space, with some other new mechanics.

There is no dev log, because over break I was focusing on family and only working on this in the down times. I didn't want to commit to documenting everything, apart from the commits themselves.
