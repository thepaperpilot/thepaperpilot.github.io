todo.md is a web app for listing things to do in _beautiful_ **markdown**. Using a plaintext standard makes your todo list easy to version control, sync, and of course independent of the tool you use.

This app specifically adds features like filtering and collapsing to allow you to more easily read and act upon even the largest of todo lists- and best of all? It's all automatically synced to Google Drive so you can access your list from any device, anywhere.
