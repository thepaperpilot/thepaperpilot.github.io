The Optispeech project involves designing and testing a real-time tongue model that can be viewed in a transparent head while a subject talks â€” for the purposes of treating speech errors and teaching foreign language sounds. This work has been conducted in partnership with Vulintus and with support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The UT Dallas Speech Production Lab is currently updating the program to use updated versions of Unity and adding support for more features and hardware.
