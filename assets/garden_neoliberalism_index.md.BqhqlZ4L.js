It became popular with the advent of President Raegan, Margaret Thatcher, and similar figures. They made sweeping changes to their respective economies and governments (in Reagan&#39;s case also rolling back many of the very successful social programs introduced as part of the New Deal and the Great Society). In the US neoliberalism now shapes both the Republican and Democratic parties, prioritizing free markets, personal responsibility, privatization, and removing social safety nets.</p><p>Neoliberalism often supports ideas like meritocracies, calling them fair and just. However, meritocracies ignore systemic issues and frame success and failure as solely dependent on the individual. This helps maintain the current power structures under the guise of fairness.</p><p>Neoliberalism echoes the Great Man Theory by glorifying entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk as self-made visionaries. This narrative obscures the role of collective labor, public investment, and systemic privilege in their success. By framing progress as the result of exceptional individuals rather than collective effort, neoliberalism discourages [[Solidarity] and justifies wealth accumulating in fewer and fewer hands.</p><p>Relatedly, liberal movements will tend to focus more on an individual to be rallied upon - Barack Obama, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, etc. - whereas leftist movements will tend to focus more on the movement and it&#39;s positive collective impacts, like the blank panthers or various protests and riots throughout history. That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t individuals who helped create or guide those movements, but there typically isn&#39;t a &quot;face&quot; of the movement/revolution.</p>',6),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"Neoliberalism","description":"","frontmatter":{"alias":"Neoliberal","public":"true","slug":"neoliberalism","title":"Neoliberalism","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/neoliberalism/index.md","filePath":"garden/neoliberalism/index.md"}'),h={name:"garden/neoliberalism/index.md"},_=Object.assign(h,{setup(u){const i=r();return(p,f)=>(l(),s("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[n("206 words, ~1 minute read.
