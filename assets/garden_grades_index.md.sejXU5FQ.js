They are not good measures of mastery of a topic, and they are not used that way. They promote an overly simplistic and rigid view of what intelligence is and stifle creativity, experimentation, and the desire to learn for its own sake. They, as with all source of extrinsic <a href="/garden/motivation/">Motivation</a>, lead to conformity and control rather than actually instilling change in long-term behaviors.</p><p>Grades often more closely represent socioeconomic status than general skill or intelligence, because stuff like amount of time a person had to study, what resources they had access to when learning or studying the material, their physical and mental well-being, and other factors are going to be dependent on socioeconomic status and significantly impact test scoring. In this way, having tests whose scores lead to opportunities to go to better schools or get better scholarships serve to reinforce power structures. This serves to argue why meritocracies are largely a <a href="/garden/neoliberalism/">Neoliberal</a> myth.</p><p>Grades could be better used to assess mastery of a topic and when a student is ready to move on. However, our current education system is very rigidly paced and only let&#39;s students continue learning the material they didn&#39;t master by retaking the entire year, or, if they are fortunate enough to have access to it, external educational services like tutoring. A self paced system could properly assess students mastery in a way that isn&#39;t punishing and actually gets used to ensure students are learning every topic they move on from.</p><p>Grades are also used as part of &quot;no child left behind&quot; to determine distribution of resources. However, this encourages teaching &quot;to the test&quot;, which doesn&#39;t always correlate with actual mastery of the subjects, and doesn&#39;t respond well to reasons why certain areas might focus on some topics over others. For example, a community where English isn&#39;t a common language at home or in stores will still pour resources into teaching English until the test scores improve. This funding also did nothing to fix social ills that were likely to impact the students&#39; learning ability - its hard to focus on school if you&#39;re worrying about whether or not you&#39;ll have food and shelter after school lets out for the day. It did not help students spend longer on topics to ensure they properly understand it before moving on, and it did not help those who mastered a topic quickly move on sooner, causing issues for both groups.</p><p>Such a self paced system should also just be pass/fail (or rather: mastered and not yet mastered), alleviating the pressure on students and not mixing subjects mastery with general intelligence. This allows students to experiment with topics, even if they get things wrong at first, and properly engage with the material rather than merely memorizing things for the test and then forgetting it.</p>',8),w=JSON.parse('{"title":"Grades","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"grades","tags":["Education"],"title":"Grades","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/grades/index.md","filePath":"garden/grades/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/grades/index.md"},v=Object.assign(u,{setup(m){const a=o();return(g,p)=>(l(),r("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[n("496 words, ~3 minute read.
