It recognizes systemic issues are typically at fault rather than individual failings.</p><p>Police abolitionists still want to ensure public safety, just not through policing and incarceration. They believe, since most crime is not born of malice, that improving society by ensuring everyone&#39;s needs are met would evaporate the majority of crimes as well - at least as many as are prevented by the current system. This is an idea fundamentally aligned with <a href="/garden/materialism/">Materialism</a>. Police are incredibly over funded, enough to buy things like <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/towns-dont-need-tanks-they-have-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">surplus tanks</a> from the US military. That money can instead go to social programs that would solve the root causes that lead to crimes.</p><p>Societies can and will find alternative ways of preventing any specific crime. An often used example is if you have a drunk friend who is about to drive home, you typically will help get them a ride (driving yourself if you&#39;re sober, or calling them a cab or uber otherwise) rather than calling the police on them. Abolitionism finds policing as only required by those who lack the political imagination to find other solutions - basically, cure the diseases rather than treat the symptoms. At a systemic level, drunk driving can be reduced or eliminated by improving public transit.</p>',5),v=JSON.parse('{"title":"Transformative Justice","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"transformative-justice","title":"Transformative Justice","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/transformative-justice/index.md","filePath":"garden/transformative-justice/index.md"}'),m={name:"garden/transformative-justice/index.md"},_=Object.assign(m,{setup(h){const a=s();return(p,f)=>(l(),r("div",null,[c,e("p",null,[n("219 words, ~1 minute read.
