Essentially it just removes the exploitation involved when a capital owner takes the product of its workers labor value and only compensates those workers for less than its worth. I believe a market socialist economy could theoretically be achieved through reform rather than revolution (if you can prevent the owning class from stalling attempts to do so), but to go any further left (abolishing currency) would likely require revolution.</p><p>The way the means of production would shift to being collectively owned by the workers is by making all the workers collectively decide the direction of the company, including wages and other policies. This would mean there are no capital owners, no shareholders, no stocks, etc. The goal is that people solely earn an income through their labor, preventing owning capital to snowball into owning more capital, trending towards consolidating wealth in fewer and fewer hands.</p><p>By framing it as &quot;capitalism with less exploitation and a more true meritocracy&quot;, I think it can actually appeal to non-leftists and introduce them to the idea that socialism isn&#39;t what they&#39;ve been led to believe it is.</p><p>One particular issue with capitalism that would still be present under market socialism is having various benefits tied to your job. If the only way you can get food, water, shelter, and healthcare is through employment, then you can be &quot;locked in&quot; to a bad job. For that reason, you&#39;d still need a strong social safety net providing those necessities for life, freeing people to leave their job for whatever reason - leaving a bad job, taking a mental health break, refining a skill, being a parent, etc.</p><p>Individuals can still have ideas for startups and seek money to help get it off the ground. However, that process will look different. Friends and family can donate money or labor, but money must be gifted, not exchanged for partial ownership of the company. The state can maintain a fund for helping startups, made up of taxes and going to those with successful pitches. An important aspect of all of this is that the initial person is not <em>the</em> owner of the company, and would be at the same level as any other worker, regardless of role and when they joined the company. Founding a company should not and would not give them the ability to exploit the surplus labor value of the other workers. It&#39;s okay to not have corporations founded under that motivation, as the real motivation should be individuals seeing a way to improve society and acting upon it.</p><p>In a capitalist society, most corporations are owned in large part by capitalists and have a very hierarchical structure. However, even without policy change local worker&#39;s co-operatives that are collectively owned by workers can and have existed. These might make concessions to help succeed in a hostile capitalist environment, like not giving ownership to employees until they&#39;ve met certain requirements. It&#39;s still incremental progress towards market socialism and will <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/05/cooperatives-dsa-left-strategy-solidarity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">help shift society more socialist</a>. If you have any of these around you, support them as an act of <a href="/garden/solidarity/">Solidarity</a>!</p><p>By democratizing how each company operates, technological advancement would shift from helping the owners to the workers (since they are the owners). They&#39;re more likely to utilize those improvements to increase pay and reduce hours, and even if they decide to put the additional cashflow into something else, it would have been a democratic decision to do so.</p><p>China enacted a <a href="https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/insights-and-events/insights/2024/01/employees-participation-in-corporate-governance-under-the-revised-chinese-company-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">policy</a> in 2024 to make all of its corporations operate democratically, with a &quot;Employee Assembly&quot; made up of up to 100 workers, that can decide on things like firing supervisors or, in big companies, appointing 1/3 of the board of directors. That goes a long way in democratizing the remaining private businesses in China.</p>',10),w=JSON.parse('{"title":"Market Socialism","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"market-socialism","title":"Market Socialism","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/market-socialism/index.md","filePath":"garden/market-socialism/index.md"}'),p={name:"garden/market-socialism/index.md"},v=Object.assign(p,{setup(m){const a=i();return(u,f)=>(l(),n("div",null,[c,e("p",null,[s("643 words, ~4 minute read.
