Awe, intimacy, and group consciousness seem to compromise self-sovereignty and claims to ownership (IP!). In actuality, awe opens us to the fuller realization that our individual and collective identities are mutually reinforcing. Instead of embracing awe, however, the frightened individual panics. We build walls instead of tearing them down. - Douglas Rushkoff</p></blockquote><h2 id="further-reading" tabindex="-1">Further Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further Reading&quot;">​</a></h2><p>These are people and ideas that are somewhat related to my ideas on identity and personality, which I wish to explore further:</p><ul><li>Pierre Bourdieu</li><li>Erving Goffman</li><li>Michel Foucault</li><li>Symbolic Interactionism</li></ul>',12),w=JSON.parse('{"title":"Personality","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"personality","title":"Personality","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/personality/index.md","filePath":"garden/personality/index.md"}'),c={name:"garden/personality/index.md"},v=Object.assign(c,{setup(p){const a=r();return(m,f)=>(l(),o("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[n("337 words, ~2 minute read.
