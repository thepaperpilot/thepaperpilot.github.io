We &quot;exist&quot;, and the things around us &quot;exist&quot;, but what does that actually mean? Personally, I believe existence is tied to having some sort of effect on a conscious observer, and the scope of that existence is limited to said observed. This aligns well with my views on <a href="/garden/constructivism/">Constructivism</a> and has interesting interactions with Sartre&#39;s Existentialism.</p><h2 id="existentialism" tabindex="-1">Existentialism <a class="header-anchor" href="#existentialism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Existentialism&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Sartre argued that our existence is defined by ourselves via our experiences and choices throughout life. This applies to conscious observers, or &quot;being-for-itself&quot; as Sartre put it.</p><p>Inanimate objects still exist despite their lack of consciousness and ability to make choices. Sartre called these &quot;being-in-itself&quot;. They exist, but in an entirely different form from conscious observers.</p><h2 id="social-constructivism" tabindex="-1">Social Constructivism <a class="header-anchor" href="#social-constructivism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Social Constructivism&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Social constructivism argues that we learn via our experiences, essentially building a mental model of reality - always imperfect, but increasing in nuance as we gather new experiences. In this framework, objective reality arguably doesn&#39;t &quot;exist&quot;, only our subjective perception of it does. Existence, then, is dependent on a conscious observer whose mental model defines what exists to that observer.</p><p>This creates interesting conclusions about just what exists to any specific person. There may be a person living in a home 20 miles away from you who you&#39;ve never met, will never directly interact with, and that you have never learned anything about. They exist to many people, as part of a collective social &quot;reality&quot;, but nothing of their existence is present in your mind or mental model of that reality.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, you may read a dozen books detailing the adventures of a fictional character. You&#39;ll know their actions, their feelings, their motivations, their relationships, but there is no physical entity you can go and meet. In your mental model that has such a strong representation of this fictional character and an absent representation, which one truly exists?</p><p>This is perhaps quite radical, to imply a literal human being may exist less than a fictional character, but the point is that the person only exists in the abstract idea of what a person could be that exists in some abstract idea of what a house could be. The fictional character, by having an impact, an effect on you as the observer, is a more concrete existence to you specifically.</p><h2 id="further-reading" tabindex="-1">Further Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further Reading&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873080/The_NOexistenceN_of_you_AND_me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The NO/existence/N of you AND me</a> is a VN that discusses existentialism and related philosophical ideas, and was what led to me initially making the connection between constructivism and existentialism.</p>',12),y=JSON.parse('{"title":"Existence","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"existence","title":"Existence","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/existence/index.md","filePath":"garden/existence/index.md"}'),d={name:"garden/existence/index.md"},g=Object.assign(d,{setup(p){const a=s();return(m,f)=>(c(),n("div",null,[l,e("p",null,[o("427 words, ~2 minute read.
