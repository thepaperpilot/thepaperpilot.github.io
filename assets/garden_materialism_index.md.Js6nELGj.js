Under this argument, the way to shape public opinion is by changing the environment. For example, a materialist would argue that humans are not naturally greedy (as is evidenced by many years of history before capitalism was introduced), but rather capitalism incentivized greed and has so thoroughly taken over our environment that everyone has become greedier.

Marx used materialism to describe certain &quot;superstructures&quot;, which would include things like race and gender, which are shaped by the economic mode of production and in turn reinforce and legitimize that mode of production. I think race and gender are more aptly described as their own distinct material relations, and won&#39;t be solved on their own once merely be adopting socialism.</p>',6),y=JSON.parse('{"title":"Materialism","description":"","frontmatter":{"alias":"Materialist","public":"true","slug":"materialism","title":"Materialism","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/materialism/index.md","filePath":"garden/materialism/index.md"}'),h={name:"garden/materialism/index.md"},b=Object.assign(h,{setup(p){const i=r();return(u,g)=>(d(),n("div",null,[m,e("p",null,[s("217 words, ~1 minute read.
