For example, Louisiana's most recent redistricting (in 2024) stirred up controversy for a new district, district 6, being drawn with very weird borders, specifically to ensure it has a majority of black voters who were previously more spread out across the districts. This is classic gerrymandering that makes it so that voting bloc determines the result of that district and the one already existing majority black district, but has nominal impact on any of the other 4 districts. But this process is actually being argued to be more fair to black voters, because previous congressional maps, despite appearing more fair, were not very proportional to race by only having 1 majority black district versus 5 majority white districts.
