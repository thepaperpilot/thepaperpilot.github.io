It became popular with the advent of President Raegan, Margaret Thatcher, and similar figures. They made sweeping changes to their respective economies and governments (in Reagan&#39;s case also rolling back many of the very successful social programs introduced as part of the New Deal and the Great Society). In the US neoliberalism now shapes both the Republican and Democratic parties, prioritizing free markets, personal responsibility, privatization, and removing social safety nets.</p><p>Neoliberalism often supports ideas like meritocracies, calling them fair and just. However, meritocracies ignore systemic issues and frame success and failure as solely dependent on the individual. This helps maintain the current power structures under the guise of fairness. Further, it argues the meritocracy is natural and should be shaped solely by the market - NOT the government. People shape it by choosing what to buy and sell, rather than through politics.</p><p>Neoliberalism echoes the Great Man Theory by glorifying entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk as self-made visionaries. This narrative obscures the role of collective labor, public investment, and systemic privilege in their success. By framing progress as the result of exceptional individuals rather than collective effort, neoliberalism discourages [[Solidarity] and justifies wealth accumulating in fewer and fewer hands.</p><p>Relatedly, liberal movements will tend to focus more on an individual to be rallied upon - Barack Obama, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, etc. - whereas leftist movements will tend to focus more on the movement and it&#39;s positive collective impacts, like the blank panthers or various protests and riots throughout history. That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t individuals who helped create or guide those movements, but there typically isn&#39;t a &quot;face&quot; of the movement/revolution.</p><h2 id="neoliberalism-in-media" tabindex="-1">Neoliberalism in media <a class="header-anchor" href="#neoliberalism-in-media" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Neoliberalism in media&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A lot of our media is, intentionally or not, neoliberal propaganda. Stories focus on individual heros that save the day without emphasizing all the help they had along the way. Superheros protect the status quo from those who threaten it. Stuff like that. You defeat the bad guy, and the day is saved - if there&#39;s any sort of systemic change, it&#39;s often framed as only happening because now the good guy is in charge.</p><p>Here is a good video on the exceptions, typically from progressive media, that focus on collective action and change: <a href="https://youtu.be/gU4x-Ox8_Qo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/gU4x-Ox8_Qo</a></p><h2 id="further-reading" tabindex="-1">Further Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further Reading&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://youtu.be/i8F5FgernVY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/i8F5FgernVY</a></p>',11),y=JSON.parse('{"title":"Neoliberalism","description":"","frontmatter":{"alias":"Neoliberal","public":"true","slug":"neoliberalism","title":"Neoliberalism","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/neoliberalism/index.md","filePath":"garden/neoliberalism/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/neoliberalism/index.md"},v=Object.assign(u,{setup(m){const i=r();return(p,g)=>(l(),n("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[s("347 words, ~2 minute read.
