The US has a partially standardized education through the Common Core, which states are able to opt in or out of. The argument for standardized education is to ensure a solid knowledge baseline that all adults can be assumed to meet, and to make it easier for kids to transfer between schools, even across states.</p><p>This standardization only extends to the curriculum typically, and is not going to equalize access to educational resources, skill of the teachers, or opportunities for learning and growth in general.</p><p>I&#39;d argue that even besides standardized curriculums, though, having authoritative figures involved in the educational process at all, be they a school, a parent, or teachers in general, it is still to some degree <em>centralized</em> even if its not <em>standardized</em>. You can look at <a href="/garden/decentralized-education/">Decentralized Education</a> for a critique of the education systems in the US that goes <em>far beyond</em> the points made here.</p><h2 id="curriculum" tabindex="-1">Curriculum <a class="header-anchor" href="#curriculum" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Curriculum&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Standardized education has many drawbacks and criticisms, some more valid than others. I think the most important one is that the decision making process for what is included in a standard curriculum will inevitably be formed through a set of values that are considered universal, rigid, and unchanging. Actual societal values, being <a href="/garden/social-constructs/">Social Constructs</a>, are none of those things. This amounts to the standards being fairly contentious across the political spectrum (what can be taught, what can&#39;t, and what&#39;s left up to the states, schools, or teachers), and I for sure take issue with several of those decisions, particularly in the curriculum&#39;s reinforcement of the power structures within our society (including aspects like obedience and conformity) and being light on criticism of America&#39;s role in various historical conflicts.</p><p>Being only partially centralized and leaving contentious topics to increasingly local levels diminishes how transferrable students are, with grades potentially not lining up like they should. I think the problem here is really the rigidity of our education, where your grade level dictates where you are across all subjects. A more robust tracking of mastered subjects and segmenting education into smaller units rather than full terms would potentially allow students to move around and make sure there aren&#39;t topics being skipped over or taken additional times.</p><p>My issues with standardization go beyond just disagreeing with the current curriculums, though. Obviously I would prefer a larger focus on leftist concepts and critiquing the status quo rather than reinforcing it. But ultimately I oppose standardization because the values used to build the curriculum are going to be fuzzy and shifting, so any curriculum designed will perpetually find itself at odds with the power being subjected to it.</p><p>Further, standardization strictly limits diversity and specialization. It enforces conformity over adaptability, and tells us there&#39;s only one right way to perceive the world. It gives us all the same base knowledge, rather than something self guided where everyone&#39;s path would take them to different topics and make unique connections. Essentially, I think standardized curriculums hinder our ability to create new knowledge (discoveries).</p><h2 id="common-core" tabindex="-1">Common Core <a class="header-anchor" href="#common-core" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Common Core&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The common core is a very misunderstood concept in America, and actually I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as bad as its been made out to be, and most criticisms of it are either incorrect or would apply to any standardized education.</p><p>The standards are publicly available <a href="https://www.thecorestandards.org/read-the-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, and even comes with a nice section about the goals of the standards and importantly what they still depend on states and districts to handle, like day-to-day curricula, <em>how</em> to teach these standards, and how to ensure those with special needs and ELLs also meet the standards. For example, they don&#39;t mention reading lists, although they&#39;ll mention texts in passing which may be interpreted as a recommendation, such as in standard <a href="https://www.thecorestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RH/11-12/4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RH.11-12.4</a> which cites one of the Federalist papers. Taking listed examples as the only valid option seems to be a common issue, like with the controversial standard <a href="https://www.thecorestandards.org/Math/Content/3/OA/A/1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CCSS.Math.Content.3.OA.A.1</a> that says &quot;Interpret products of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 5 × 7 as the total number of objects in 5 groups of 7 objects each&quot;. The actual standard is the first part, the second being an example interpretation. It does NOT say interpreting &quot;5 x 7&quot; as 7 groups of five objects should be considered wrong, which is where the controversy came from. <a href="https://www.salon.com/2015/11/28/youre_wrong_about_common_core_math_sorry_parents_but_it_makes_more_sense_than_you_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This Salon article</a> (written by a math teacher with a Masters in Education) goes over a couple viral examples of common core being misinterpreted by either a parent or the educator themselves, and why the new methods do a better job at teaching number sense and the &quot;normal way&quot; still gets taught later on anyways.</p><p>While initially widely adopted, many states have opted out of common core, and even more have declined to use either consortia that provides common core aligned standardized testing. You can see which states and territories follow common core <a href="https://www.thecorestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and if you&#39;re one of the Smarter Balanced member states <a href="https://smarterbalanced.org/our-vision/partnerships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. The other testing consortium, PARCC, seems to be nearly entirely abandoned. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARCC#Test_Participation_by_States" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wikipedia</a> its only used by an educational program by the DoD and two states - Louisiana and Massachusetts - have a hybrid system composed of both PARCC and their own state tests. Needless to say, states are quite varied in which tests they use to assess common core understanding, with many states using unique solutions. This naturally limits the ability to compare how well different states teach common core.</p>',14),w=JSON.parse('{"title":"Standardized Education","description":"","frontmatter":{"alias":"Centralized Education","public":"true","slug":"standardized-education","tags":["Education"],"title":"Standardized Education","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/standardized-education/index.md","filePath":"garden/standardized-education/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/standardized-education/index.md"},b=Object.assign(u,{setup(m){const a=o();return(p,g)=>(d(),s("div",null,[l,e("p",null,[n("658 words, ~4 minute read.
