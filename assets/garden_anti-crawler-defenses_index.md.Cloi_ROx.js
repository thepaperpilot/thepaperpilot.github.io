But I&#39;m still interested in potential solutions should they become necessary.

It loads the pages slowly in an attempt to slow down the crawlers, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;ll work in practice since they likely parallelize their crawling. They give quite a few warnings about using the software, most notably that good faith crawlers may also fall in the trap and cause you to not get indexed by search engines (but I think a robots.txt entry could fix that).
