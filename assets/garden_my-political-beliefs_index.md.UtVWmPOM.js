This society should be based on <a href="/garden/free-association/">Free Association</a> to handle both decision making and ensuring people act pro-socially. This would be a post-scarcity society where everyone&#39;s needs are met via <a href="/garden/mutual-aid/">Mutual Aid</a>, and likely a good deal of automation. I believe in maximizing personal liberties so long as one is not actively harmful to others, which includes disallowing most forms of discrimination. A society built on free association would have no need for police.</p><p>I&#39;m less certain on the journey to reaching that society. I&#39;m anti-<a href="/garden/imperialism/">Imperialist</a> and believe imperialism will greatly hinder our progress towards that society. I&#39;m not sure if we would need a transitionary state like MLs suggest, but I&#39;m fairly confident one way or the other, a revolution will be necessary (hopefully a peaceful one). I think the BLM protests of 2020 may have been the closest the US has gotten to a peaceful revolution in a long time, and am hopeful that perhaps the general strike of 2028 will be our next big change at it.</p><p>Until the revolution, I&#39;d support policies that bring us closer to the ideal society. <a href="/garden/market-socialism/">Market Socialism</a> essentially outlines my goals for reformist policies until the revolution. I also think pay should be equalized across everyone in the same role. This would help reduce race and gender pay disparity and allow people to take a break from their career (having a baby, going back to college, experimenting with another industry, taking a sabbatical, etc.) with reduced negative impact. Working hard would still be incentivized due to the collective ownership of the means of production. I&#39;d also support open borders, defunding the police, and not getting involved in foreign conflicts, including stopping the destabilization of successful socialist projects.</p>',6),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"My Political Beliefs","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"my-political-beliefs","title":"My Political Beliefs","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/my-political-beliefs/index.md","filePath":"garden/my-political-beliefs/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/my-political-beliefs/index.md"},_=Object.assign(u,{setup(p){const i=o();return(m,f)=>(r(),s("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[n("230 words, ~1 minute read.
