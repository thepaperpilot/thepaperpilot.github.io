Personally, I think it&#39;s more than justified.</p><p>The main argument for clearing the debt is that college degrees have become increasingly expensive <em>and abundant</em>, thus making their return on investment significantly lower than they were historically. However, those in college joined when it was less clear that degrees were hitting a point that they weren&#39;t worth the cost of college anymore. Plus, then and today kids are propagandized that college <em>is</em> worth it, and in fact the <em>only</em> way to reliably live a successful, and therefore comfortable, life. So now we have a bunch of adults indebted for most of their lives due to a decision they made as a teenager based on promises that failed to materialize. So clearing the debt is to help them, because their misstep and debt cannot be fairly blamed on them.</p><p>The argument <em>against</em> clearing the debt is that those before had to pay off their debt, and this wouldn&#39;t be a fair deal to those who recently paid off their debt, potentially to significant personal sacrifice. I dislike using this as an argument to prevent helping people, along the same basis that I&#39;d rather discover and release cheap medicine even if people before have had to spend large amounts for the existing medicine. Additionally, people may argue that a one time clearing of debt would not permanently solve the problem. That&#39;s fair, but again personally I think its fine to wipe the debt every so often from now until the revolution, or reform that makes college accessibly and not indebting teens.</p><p>Ultimately, I think clearing the debt is justified, but we need systemic change to fully fix this problem. I believe college education <em>should</em> be accessible and its abundance is fine. I don&#39;t believe it should be seen as an investment, nor a for profit business. To that end I think colleges should be nationalized or otherwise paid for by the state, similar to the lower levels of education. This would allow people to learn more and switch majors and truly discover themselves without the pressure of digging an ever larger hold of debt. Over time, the focus should be increasingly on learning and mastery of topics, rather than GPA and a piece of paper that states you graduated college.</p>',6),y=JSON.parse('{"title":"Clearing College Debt","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"clearing-college-debt","tags":["Education"],"title":"Clearing College Debt","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/clearing-college-debt/index.md","filePath":"garden/clearing-college-debt/index.md"}'),g={name:"garden/clearing-college-debt/index.md"},_=Object.assign(g,{setup(m){const a=i();return(p,u)=>(r(),o("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[s("395 words, ~2 minute read.
