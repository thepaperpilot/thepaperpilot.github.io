Personally, I&#39;m a <a href="/garden/constructivism/">Constructivist</a> and believe most things - including identity - are mostly socially defined rather than part of one&#39;s fixed &quot;essence&quot;, with notable exceptions made for nuerologies. This has led me to apply Judith Butler&#39;s theory of gender performativity to all facets of our identity.</p><p>Essentially, I believe parts of our identity are socially defined and therefore both act upon us and are shaped by us. We get molded into certain boxes, but the box shifts over time to match our collective average shape. The same way this has applied to gender and gender roles, so too has it applied to other aspects of our identity, including race, sexual orientation, hobbies, etc. That is to say, if you identify as a geocacher, there will be social forces pushing you into the mold of what a geocacher &quot;is&quot; - you gain stereotypes and expectations. But if you push against that force, and other geocachers do too, you&#39;ll change that definition of what a geocacher &quot;is&quot;. This applies similarly to the parts of our identity we don&#39;t consent to, such as being tall or being an amputee.</p><h2 id="compositional-identity" tabindex="-1">Compositional Identity <a class="header-anchor" href="#compositional-identity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Compositional Identity&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I think our identities are essentially compositional. We identify as many things - for myself that&#39;s things like white, cis, male, philosopher, anarchist, programmer, enjoyer of narrative games, indie gamer, indie game dev, and so on - that each have their different forces that act upon us and &quot;define&quot; us. Some of those forces are stronger than others, and we&#39;re resistant to some of those forces more than others, so those labels are loose and shifting, but they all contribute to our <a href="/garden/personality/">Personality</a> and how we&#39;re perceived.</p><p>One criticism I have of the fediverse is actually how it asks you to associate your identity with a single server, effectively flattening your multi faceted identity. I wish identity online could be similarly &quot;compositional&quot;, which I think is something <a href="/garden/decentralized-identity/">Decentralized Identity</a> can accomplish.</p><h2 id="names" tabindex="-1">Names <a class="header-anchor" href="#names" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Names&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://goat.rest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">goat.rest</a> describes a society in which people, once they come of age, choose their own name. I think this would be a good thing to have in our own society, as it would help normalize the idea of people changing their names, and offer an opportunity for those who wish to change their name but don&#39;t want the stigmas currently associated with doing so. In general, I want people to be able to more freely &quot;update&quot; their identity throughout their life, to something they can more strongly associate (identify) with.</p><h2 id="memories" tabindex="-1">Memories <a class="header-anchor" href="#memories" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Memories&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I think our memories are tied to our identity very strongly, to the point where &quot;myself&quot; and &quot;my memories&quot; are near synonymous. I think that helps explain why people want to &quot;leave a mark&quot; on the world, write memoirs, and create things in general. It&#39;s why the idea of losing memories is so painful, be it from watching a loved one develop Alzheimer&#39;s, thinking about yourself develop it, or various concepts in fiction that revolve around erasing memories of things.</p><h2 id="further-reading" tabindex="-1">Further Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further Reading&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The idea of concepts both acting upon us and being defined by us applies to language as well, to which end I&#39;d like to explore the ideas of Wittgenstein and George Lakoff.</p><ul><li>Also relevant, especially with respect to Lakoff, would be Zoe Bee&#39;s video on <a href="https://youtu.be/4pPNV_B-Hpc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">metaphors</a>.</li></ul>',14),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"Identity","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"identity","title":"Identity","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/identity/index.md","filePath":"garden/identity/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/identity/index.md"},w=Object.assign(u,{setup(p){const a=i();return(m,f)=>(h(),n("div",null,[l,e("p",null,[r("469 words, ~3 minute read.
