They see a state as inherently self-preservationist and oppressive, thus that it has no place in society nor the transition to an egalitarian society.</p><p>Broadly speaking, flavors of anarchism can fall into 3 categories: collectivist anarchism, which is what this article will focus on; individualist anarchism, which are right-wing versions of anarchism based on <a href="/garden/individualism/">Individualism</a>; and modern anarchism, which are adaptations of collectivist communism to include additional hierarchies, such as anarcha-feminism which seeks to abolish the patriarchy in addition to class hierarchy. I&#39;m personally biased against individualist anarchism but align with the values present in many collectivist and modern flavors of anarchism. I believe an ideal society is one with strong <a href="/garden/local-communities/">Local Communities</a> that operate as a collective; spreading power as thinly as possible to avoid the possibility of any individuals becoming corrupt and abusing their power.</p><h2 id="decision-making-and-accountability" tabindex="-1">Decision Making and Accountability <a class="header-anchor" href="#decision-making-and-accountability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Decision Making and Accountability&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To keep power spread thinly, anarchists desire decision making systems that ensure no one rules over another, although in practice sometimes some concessions are made for logistics. Ideally, an anarchist society rely solely on <a href="/garden/free-association/">Free Association</a>, but there are historical cases of using consensus or even majoritarian democracies.</p><p>Anarchists expect people to tend to do things that fill perceived needs and benefit the society through <a href="/garden/mutual-aid/">Mutual Aid</a>, although they may do some level of coordination and assign roles to people for the purpose of larger scale industry, like running factories, trains, etc. If there is a decision making process that <em>does</em> lead to some responsibilities being assigned to a specific person, that role would have to be considered replaceable at all times, so that the person assigned the role can freely leave the agreement. This would also lead to a form of accountability, since the group could choose to assign someone else to do that task.</p><p>Free association would naturally handle most other needs for accountability. It would certainly remove the need for any form of police. The guarantee of one&#39;s needs being met should almost entirely eradicate crime anyways, and crime would typically be responded to with &quot;transformative justice&quot;, where underlying causes are fixed rather than punishing the criminal.</p><h2 id="anarchy-and-capitalism" tabindex="-1">Anarchy and Capitalism <a class="header-anchor" href="#anarchy-and-capitalism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Anarchy and Capitalism&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The definition of individualist anarchism, one of the three categories defined in the introduction, is quite contested amongst anarchists. Some deny that its <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/joe-peacott-individualism-reconsidered" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">distinct from collectivist socialism and worth consideration</a>, others claim it <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/geoffrey-ostergaard-anarchism-blackwell-dictionary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">includes anarcho-capitalism,</a> and yet others deny that capitalism <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq-full#text-amuse-label-secf0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">is even compatible with anarchism</a> at all. As the broad categories are just trying to make it easier to analyze different flavors of anarchism, I think its sufficient to say individualist anarchism is not really a useful term, as it typically needs clarification upon use of what individualist anarchism means to that author specifically.</p><p>I will take a strong position in favor of the argument that capitalism is inherently incompatible with anarchism, though. Capitalism inherently forms hierarchies by introducing currency as a coercive force that is then required for continued survival. Anarcho-capitalism, the theoretical blending of capitalism and anarchism, argues for a stateless society with a market economy, effectively instituting laissez-faire economics. Anarcho-capitalism argues this market would regulate itself naturally due to the exchange of goods being purely voluntary, however this ignores capitalist incentives that would trend the economy towards wealth accumulating in the hands of the few. This creates a coercive hierarchy, which is not voluntary due to people&#39;s need for food, water, and shelter. The only way to avoid this unjust hierarchy would be with a form of regulatory body that would be nothing short of a state. Therefore, anarcho-capitalism is not compatible with anarchism, because despite their shared antipathy towards states, they do not share the underlying antipathy towards hierarchy.</p><p>Anarcho-capitalists argue that their vision of anarchism is the <a href="https://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">only form that could possibly exist in reality</a>, as any other form necessitates a state in order to handle things like the redistribution of private property. However, this argument itself implies the necessity of private property as a concept. Collectivist forms of anarchy such as anarcho-communism or mutualism demonstrate how economies can work without private property.</p><h2 id="further-reading" tabindex="-1">Further Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further Reading&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anarchy works</a> is an accessible and modern text on how an anarchistic society would look, how anarchism has already been successful, and how western education has merely taught us to believe anarchism does not work.</p><p><a href="https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/anarchism-in-the-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anarchism in the now</a> is a response to the 2024 US elections with how we can start working towards anarchism today, written by the hacker who leaked the no fly list.</p>',16),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"Anarchism","description":"","frontmatter":{"alias":"Anarchist","public":"true","slug":"anarchism","tags":["Leftism"],"title":"Anarchism","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/anarchism/index.md","filePath":"garden/anarchism/index.md"}'),m={name:"garden/anarchism/index.md"},w=Object.assign(m,{setup(u){const t=r();return(p,f)=>(h(),s("div",null,[c,e("p",null,[n("701 words, ~4 minute read.
