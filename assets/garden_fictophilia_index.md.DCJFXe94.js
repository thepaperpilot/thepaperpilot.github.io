It&#39;s not something I personally have, but I think its interesting as a form of attraction that hasn&#39;t been normalized in today&#39;s society, yet seems fairly reasonable. From what I&#39;ve seen online there are some resources on &quot;overcoming&quot; fictophilia, but on the whole it seems to be accepted as something relatively innocuous and not concerning.</p><p>Typically fictophilia refers to the attraction to characters from media. This is similar to &quot;waifus&quot;, but with fully realized attraction. But I think it could similarly to relationships with LLMs, like Replika and similar services.</p><p>My opinions on <a href="/garden/existence/">Existence</a> lead me to generally find fictophilia as falling under &quot;love is love&quot; - not for me, but perfectly fine. No one is harmed here. I don&#39;t think it makes sense to judge people for fictophilia. After all, its okay for people to be aromantic or asexual which similarly don&#39;t involve relationships with real people. And indeed, I think these relationships can be a bit of a safe haven for those who are afraid of being taken advantage of or otherwise harmed by an IRL relationship.</p><p>I do think there is a bit of a concern of fictional relationships subtly reinforcing unrealistic expectations of a relationship, but by the nature of fictophilia I&#39;m not sure that actually harms anyone <em>in practice</em>. But I&#39;m not totally sure here. And it&#39;s not like we&#39;re born knowing what a healthy relationship looks like anyways, or how to navigate difficult moments. I think any of these issues can be pretty easily resolved by still having <em>some</em> form of relationship (including non-romantic ones) with real people still. I guess I just don&#39;t super approve of someone isolating themselves from all of society.</p>',6),g=JSON.parse('{"title":"Fictophilia","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"fictophilia","title":"Fictophilia","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/fictophilia/index.md","filePath":"garden/fictophilia/index.md"}'),d={name:"garden/fictophilia/index.md"},v=Object.assign(d,{setup(f){const a=o();return(m,u)=>(l(),n("div",null,[h,e("p",null,[s("302 words, ~2 minute read.
