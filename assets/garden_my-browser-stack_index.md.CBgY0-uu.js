At this point I really just recommend any fork of Firefox (such as Zen). Mozilla has seen its fair share of controversy, but nowhere near the amount Google has, and it&#39;s worth using a Firefox based browser in order to fight the chrome monopoly.</p><p>Other great Firefox forks to look at are <a href="https://librewolf.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">librewolf</a> and <a href="https://www.waterfox.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">waterfox</a>, which are privacy centric and lightweight and run faster than stock firefox.</p><h2 id="extensions" tabindex="-1">Extensions <a class="header-anchor" href="#extensions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Extensions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A classic recommendation you&#39;ve probably already heard, <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">uBlock Origin</a> is a requirement for browsing the internet. Ads spy on you and significantly degrade your browsing experience, and this extension fixes that. Gorhill, it&#39;s creator, deserves so much appreciation for the service they&#39;ve done to the entire world.</p><h3 id="youtube" tabindex="-1">Youtube <a class="header-anchor" href="#youtube" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Youtube&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If you browse YouTube in your browser, you might be interested in these extensions as well:</p><p><a href="https://sponsor.ajay.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sponsorblock</a> uses crowd sourced information on YouTube videos to automatically skip past parts you don&#39;t care about, like sponsor reads or calls to like or subscribe.</p><p><a href="https://dearrow.ajay.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DeArrow</a> uses crowd sourced information on YouTube videos to replace the original titles with more descriptive ones (to avoid click bait). It&#39;ll also replace thumbnails with random frames from the video itself. Note this extension asks for a $1 donation or to request free access, which can take a few hours (but you can &quot;trial&quot; the extension in the meantime).</p><h2 id="search" tabindex="-1">Search <a class="header-anchor" href="#search" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Search&quot;">​</a></h2><p>With the advent of AI generated content, it has become much more difficult to search the web. Here&#39;s some techniques to find useful, original, human made resources.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to clean up your mainstream search engine results(Google, DuckDuckGo, or Bing), you can use the <a href="https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Huge AI Blocklist</a>. The list works with uBlock Origin, but they recommend using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">uBlacklist</a>, an extension specifically for blocking certain Google search results.</p><p>If you&#39;re willing to pay, <a href="https://kagi.com/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kagi</a> is a premium search engine you may be interested in. Being a paid service, it doesn&#39;t rely on ads or tracking to make a profit, and has a great reputation for high quality results and additional features free search engines don&#39;t have like personalized rankings for domains.</p><p>There is also an independent search engine called <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Marginalia</a> that designed to show you non commercialized sites that are typically smaller and independent, which acts as a great filter to only see human made resources.</p><p>Finally, if your goal is just privacy, the extension mentioned in the following section will help redirect you to alternative search engines as well.</p><h2 id="privacy-respecting-front-ends" tabindex="-1">Privacy respecting front ends <a class="header-anchor" href="#privacy-respecting-front-ends" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Privacy respecting front ends&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There are many projects out there that offer sites you can go to that interface with popular but not privacy respecting websites like YouTube or Twitter. This is personally a bit overkill for me, but I&#39;ve considered using them in the past. Rather than looking up each alternative directly and finding a working instance, I recommend just using a regularly maintained extension that automatically redirects you from the popular site to a working instance of the alternative frontend, like <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Privacy Redirect</a>.</p>',19),y=JSON.parse('{"title":"My Browser Stack","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"my-browser-stack","title":"My Browser Stack","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/my-browser-stack/index.md","filePath":"garden/my-browser-stack/index.md"}'),d={name:"garden/my-browser-stack/index.md"},k=Object.assign(d,{setup(p){const a=o();return(f,m)=>(l(),n("div",null,[c,e("p",null,[i("447 words, ~2 minute read.
