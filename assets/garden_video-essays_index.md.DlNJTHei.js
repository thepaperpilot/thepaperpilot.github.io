I <em>love</em> video essays, they&#39;re often entertaining and you can tell the effort and care put into them. A lot of my favorite creators are video essayists, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/hbomberguy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hbomberguy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FoldingIdeas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Folding Ideas</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zoe_bee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zoe Bee</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PhilosophyTube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Philosophy Tube</a> (and probably more - its hard to keep track of my favorites since they upload infrequently). Unfortunately, video essays have now been recognized as successful ways to make videos with high watch time which has led to an explosion of video essays, with varying levels of skill, ethics, and effort put into researching the topics.</p><p>The format of video essays makes them feel credible - being longform, speaking authoritatively, and including relevant footage all contribute to this. However, none of those actually necessitate the creator being a subject matter expert.</p><p>&quot;Video essayists&quot; as a concept is a bit concerning because it positions those creators on a treadmill of constantly having to be (or at least appear to be) an expert of a brand new topic. I&#39;m skeptical of any video essayist that uploads frequently or across a very large variety of topics. The essayists above all have clear fields they <em>are</em> experts in (like Abigail Thorn being a philosopher or Zoe Bee being an educator). Those who aren&#39;t already experts in a specific field should take the time to <em>become</em> an expert on a topic during the process of making the video, with an upload schedule that reflects that (e.g. hbomberguy).</p><p>Sometimes the extra duration of the footage is less to do with it deeply diving into the subject matter, but padding and fluff that&#39;s tangential to the point of the video. This is stuff like describing the process of how the creator did online research, or the methods they used to reach out to relevant people. In addition to padding the runtime, this shifts the focus off the subject of the video and onto the creator. I found <a href="https://youtu.be/ZYcHOEjGzPA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this video</a> to exemplify both this issue and many of my other qualms with video essays.</p><h2 id="media-analysis-video-essays" tabindex="-1">Media Analysis Video Essays <a class="header-anchor" href="#media-analysis-video-essays" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Media Analysis Video Essays&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Some video essays are very easy to make quickly and are doing so for profit. No video essay exemplifies this more than the media analysis video essay. While this doesn&#39;t apply to <em>all</em> video essays over media, all too often they&#39;ll just be summaries of popular and nostalgic media that never gets into any meaningful analysis or offering genuine insights. It&#39;s just an easy way to make a lot of content, and thus watch time.</p><p>The epitome of this is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNkfKT_xRl1NEZ0YFw11TORoRBIMcxrY0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">series of videos</a> I used to watch but now avoid where Quinton Reviews goes over every episode in a few related series (iCarly, Victorious, and Sam and Cat) with a brief synopsis for each and some very surface level analysis like &quot;they did crimes and got away with it because their main characters&quot;. It&#39;s more of a review or retrospective than a video essay, but the criticism remains that its slop content: no one is genuinely watching a 5 hour video that summarizes each episode in order to determine if they should watch the series themselves or not. It&#39;s just something to kill 5 hours. While of course I&#39;m sure it took great effort to make, because of the sheer quantity of material to work through, it didn&#39;t require engaging critically with the media, at least not deeply. I will say the Dan Schneider video is an exception with a clear message its trying to convey.</p><p>LS Mark does similar videos over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBQI1z_v8kmvmPn8aSLhkhMNvmgOhXnSf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ranking episodes</a> of popular and nostalgic cartoons. I haven&#39;t watched them personally but would be highly suspect of these 5+ hour videos producing insight that justifies that runtime.</p><p>There are genuinely good media analysis video essays, but those are the ones that have something to actually say. You can, for example, analyze media through various lenses; like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LilySimpson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lily Simpson</a> going over trans representation in media by analyzing specific episodes that portray a trans or trans-adjacent person or persons. Lily&#39;s videos are great and show you can do media analysis <em>and</em> release content regularly, without it being slop.</p><p>Personally, I think media analysis video essays that stick to just summarizing and reviewing the media are following a long standing trend of critiquing media almost just for content / the sake of it. Red letter media, YMS, AVGN, IHE, and Cinema Sins all exemplify this trend (although not an exhaustive list by any means). I think this kind of content is for stroking people&#39;s intellectual egos; By watching media get lightly criticized, we position ourselves above the people actually out there creating original media. As has often been observed, its easier to criticize than to create. These videos are for the pretentious, who likely watch far more analysis of original media than original media itself. It&#39;s reaction content for those who feel they&#39;re above reaction content. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj694hdG6u8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This video essay</a> (heh) goes further into the issues with this type of video essay. <a href="/garden/the-beginner-s-guide/">The Beginner&#39;s Guide</a> also goes over the relationship of media creator and consumer.</p><h2 id="further-reading" tabindex="-1">Further Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further Reading&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Hey, did you know there&#39;s video essays about how video essays are bad? Well of course they are, a natural extension of the &quot;thing bad&quot; trend exemplified in the media analysis video essays and in Youtube culture at large. Anyways, I enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx635p4tSfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this video</a> covering other criticisms of video essays on Youtube.</p><p>Perhaps tangential, but I like Noodle&#39;s videos and he has one about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPohAvSfcxU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">critiquing video games</a>, particularly popular titles.</p>',15),v=JSON.parse('{"title":"Video Essays","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"video-essays","title":"Video Essays","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/video-essays/index.md","filePath":"garden/video-essays/index.md"}'),c={name:"garden/video-essays/index.md"},b=Object.assign(c,{setup(y){const a=s();return(f,m)=>(h(),i("div",null,[l,e("p",null,[r("867 words, ~5 minute read.
