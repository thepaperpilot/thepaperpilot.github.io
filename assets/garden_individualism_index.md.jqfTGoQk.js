It argues for taking care of oneself before others, and that it&#39;s wrong for people to be forced to take care of others before their selves, i.e. via wealth redistribution. This value system is antithetical to the <a href="/garden/anarchism/">Anarchist</a> values of community and mutual aid. I personally am against individualism and see it as against human&#39;s nature of cooperation. We&#39;re a social people and have for our entire existence relied upon each other.</p><p>As a personal anecdote, I&#39;m a recent parent and the whole &quot;it takes a village&quot; adage makes a lot of sense, and has made me hyper aware of how individualism has made it very hard to raise a kid these days. Even kids are seen as free loaders, and are encouraged to move out after high school. That means there&#39;s no longer 3+ generations living in a house anymore, contributing to urban sprawl and making <a href="/garden/parenting/">Parenting</a> rely more difficult for couples who have a weaker support network (since help us now a drive away rather than living with them). Suburbs are spread out and isolating, preventing strong <a href="/garden/local-communities/">Local Communities</a> from forming. To sum up, the &quot;village&quot; doesn&#39;t exist anymore.</p><p>Hyper individualism is a modern invention, not a &quot;good ole traditional value&quot; we should all aspire to. It was explicitly created by capitalist values, and replaced pre-existing value systems that prioritized co-operation.</p><h2 id="individuality" tabindex="-1">Individuality <a class="header-anchor" href="#individuality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Individuality&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Just to clarify something because the names are similar, but individualism is NOT about individuality.
