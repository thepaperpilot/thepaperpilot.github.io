In general, you can define a spectrum of how thin the decision making power is spread amongst the polity (the group of people the decision will apply to). Innuendo Studios argues that how thin decision making power is spread is the core difference between leftist and rightist thought in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agzNANfNlTs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Alt-Right Playbook: Always a Bigger Fish</a>.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, we have systems where only a few or even a single person rule over the rest. The metric for how this person or group gained that power varies, and could involve birthright, religion, or similar. Notably, we&#39;re trying to describe who wields the power in actuality, not merely in title. So a single party state may not fall under this category if the actual decision making process still involves citizens having an equal voice, and a <a href="/garden/representative-democracy/">Representative Democracy</a> where the choices are limited and corruptible by, say, corporate lobbying, may fall under this category.</p><p>A <a href="/garden/direct-democracy/">Majoritarian Democracy</a> spreads the power fairly thinly, and is seen today in nations with national referendums. These are typically limited to major decisions since the logistics of collecting votes from all citizens is not trivial. While better than being ruled by only a few people, this still imposes the will of the many over the will of the few. This can and has lead to an oppressed minority.</p><p>Democracies can also weigh different people&#39;s votes differently. The US does this in the presidential elections via the electoral college, which places additional weight on votes from smaller states. Additionally, by assigning an entire state&#39;s delegates to a single candidate, the US has formed &quot;swing states&quot;, the citizens of which hold significantly more power over who becomes president than citizens of other states. Other ways votes could be weighted differently is by granting citizens additional votes based on their merits, which would be considered a <a href="/garden/technocracy/">Technocracy</a>, or by stripping votes from people for various reasons, which is called disenfranchisement.</p><p>Disenfranchisement can happen for many different reasons. Most nations, for example, only allow their citizens to vote. This may seem like an obvious restriction to make, but there are many restrictions on citizenship that can lead to a significant amount of people being affected by laws they have no influence over at all. Similarly for age restrictions, which, like literacy tests, are ostensibly justified as ensuring only educated people can vote, but in practice have the same effect of making people affected by laws they have no influence over. This logic similarly applies to felons not being able to vote, and more subtle things like not having voting days national holidays or not providing sufficiently accessible ways of voting for those with disabilities.</p><p>On the far end of the spectrum, we have decision making where decisions are only made once every individual in the process agrees to it. This includes <a href="/garden/consensus-democracy/">Consensus Democracy</a>, where a polity discusses the problem until they can arrive at a solution everyone (or close to everyone) approves the proposed solution. A variant simply called <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-consensus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Consensus</a> describes a system where everyone implicitly supports any decisions made, and blocks a decision whenever that&#39;s not true (at which point it can be iterated upon or dropped entirely, similar to consensus democracies).</p><p>This end of the spectrum would also include any society that respects <a href="/garden/free-association/">Free Association</a>, which manifests as a fully decentralized decision making process. Free association can scale better than consensus or consensus democracy, which typically need to work as a federation of small communities in order to be feasible, like <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-what-is-communalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Communalism</a> (written by an ex-anarchist) or <a href="https://www.sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sociocracy</a> (written by proto-anarchist thinkers and described as &quot;one particular way to put anarchist values into practice&quot; in <a href="https://www.sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy-and-anarchism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sociocracy and Anarchism</a>).</p><p>There are criticisms that even on this end of the spectrum, coercion is inevitable. A consensus democracy may lead to compromise or broken promises that members of the polity only agree to begrudgingly because its better than not having the problem dealt with at all. Other times, a member who was initially supportive of a decision may come to regret that decision, but now that it&#39;s in place they&#39;d need to make everyone else agree to undo it as well. And to a certain degree, social consequences or just people&#39;s persuasiveness can lead to coercive force. For the most part, these are typically considered tolerable for the sake of society to function.</p>',11),w=JSON.parse('{"title":"Decision Making","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"decision-making","title":"Decision Making","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/decision-making/index.md","filePath":"garden/decision-making/index.md"}'),p={name:"garden/decision-making/index.md"},b=Object.assign(p,{setup(m){const t=o();return(y,f)=>(c(),n("div",null,[l,e("p",null,[r("628 words, ~3 minute read.
