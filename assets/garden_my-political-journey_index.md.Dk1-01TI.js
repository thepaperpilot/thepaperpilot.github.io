Since this website contains content from as far back as 2006, when I was only 10 years old, I&#39;d like to make it extremely clear that I have changed as a person, as we all have, and disavow a lot of my older opinions, roughly everything before 2020 or so but to be safe let&#39;s just give a dynamic (current date - 2 years). It&#39;s likely you are on this page from viewing a timeline post from that range and clicking the banner. There are bits in that period I may still agree with, but perhaps it would be best to just assume I don&#39;t have a stance on it unless there&#39;s something more recent about it. Pages in the garden section of this site are evergreen though, meaning I&#39;ll keep them up to date as my views change. Feel completely free to judge me for my opinions in there.</p><h2 id="core-beliefs" tabindex="-1">Core beliefs <a class="header-anchor" href="#core-beliefs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Core beliefs&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I believe I&#39;ve been fairly political since I was quite young, and had a relatively consistent set of core values that have just been expressed in different ways and through different lenses during different points of my life. For example I&#39;ve always believed in fairness, but have used that belief to both argue for and against affirmative action. Concepts like freedom or meritocracies have similarly been redefined as I&#39;ve become more aware of the influence of imperialism and colonialism on our cultural values and society.</p><p>Other beliefs of mine have always been around, but I just wasn&#39;t informed enough to properly express my views. I&#39;ve voiced for a very long time that I think society will inevitably trend towards post-scarcity, a world without class, currency, or jobs, where all our needs and desires are met fully, automatically, and sustainably. I&#39;ve never once pictured that society retaining a hierarchy of wealth or power in any way. But I would not have recognized that as an anarchistic society until relatively recently, mostly due to misinformation and propaganda against anarchy.</p><h2 id="anti-sjw" tabindex="-1">Anti-SJW <a class="header-anchor" href="#anti-sjw" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Anti-SJW&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Alright, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re specifically on this page because you saw me upvote something on r/KotakuInAction or like a video from PSASitch or something like that. I&#39;m not proud of this time period, where I read and watched a bit of Anti-SJW content. I&#39;m glad to have moved on from this point of my life, and wish it hadn&#39;t happened in the first place. I don&#39;t really have any excuses, but appreciate understanding that I have grown as a person since this time.</p><p>I migrated a LOT of posts to this website for the sake of having them all in one place and under my control, rather than other websites&#39;. I have not been able to look through the tens of thousands of posts (mostly upvotes/likes), but have done some basic filtering of these opinions I no longer hold. I&#39;m open about the fact I once held these beliefs, but I don&#39;t need to be de facto promoting them by sharing them on this website. If you stumble across a post you think I&#39;d rather not have on this site anymore, please <a href="https://www.thepaperpilot.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">reach out</a>.</p><h2 id="radicalization" tabindex="-1">Radicalization <a class="header-anchor" href="#radicalization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Radicalization&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I believe a lot of things contributed to my radicalization, which happened sometime in the early 2020s. Ultimately I think I was just aware that I didn&#39;t really like the views I was being exposed to, the direction that media was trying to to pull me, and slowly over time just engaged less and less with that kind of content. I&#39;d always been very economically leftist, so just needed to get over my edgy/cringe phase. I think what put the nail in the coffin was watching through the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJA_jUddXvY7v0VkYRbANnTnzkA_HMFtQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">alt right playbook</a>, a great series I highly recommend. I also started really enjoying a lot of leftist creators, like <a href="https://twitch.tv/hasanabi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hasanabi</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/@philosophytube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">philosophy tube</a>, and others. The people around me also affect my views, and after leaving college I think I interacted with nicer people on average. Of particular note here is my wife, who had their own political journey which has similarly culminated in us sort of having a positive feedback loop further and further left. Certain events like the BLM protests following George Floyd similarly cemented our position further and further left.</p><p>I actually want to also point out I&#39;ve found a lot of people in this space to be very accepting of people who previously held problematic beliefs. It&#39;s largely why I feel comfortable (enough) having a lot of my history public both on this page and the site in general, and being able to describe how my political journey got me to where I am today, a radical <a href="/garden/leftism/">Leftist</a>.</p><p>Today I&#39;m still learning and exploring the various leftist political ideologies, and finding what I align most with. I use this garden as a way of engaging with what I read, to gauge my understanding and provide the impetus for me collecting my thoughts.</p>',13),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"My Political Journey","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"my-political-journey","title":"My Political Journey","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/my-political-journey/index.md","filePath":"garden/my-political-journey/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/my-political-journey/index.md"},v=Object.assign(u,{setup(p){const a=o();return(m,f)=>(l(),n("div",null,[h,e("p",null,[r("758 words, ~4 minute read.
