It&#39;s a <a href="/garden/digital-gardens/">Digital Garden</a> collecting my thoughts in varying levels of completeness on basically anything I have interest in. It&#39;s wiki-style, but not like Wikipedia. Each page is going to be biased and argumentative, and based on my understanding of the concept at the time of writing (with regular updates to reflect new understandings). On the more fleshed out articles I&#39;ll typically adopt the structure of a persuasive essay and include sources.</p><p>Since starting this digital garden, I&#39;ve been writing a <em>lot</em>. Brief hiatuses aside, I&#39;m writing on <em>something</em> nearly every day. I keep a lot of pages private, including all my daily journal pages, and only make a garden page public once I&#39;m sufficiently happy with the state of it. As time goes on, I should also update and improve older pages to meet any increase in standards new pages have. This process of writing and updating pages has really helped me collect my thoughts and essentially check my understanding of a topic.</p><p>I write to my garden using <a href="/garden/logseq/">Logseq</a>.
