Marx spends a good amount of time in The Community Manifesto describing Capitalism and how and why it succeeded Feudalism, including Capitalism&#39;s superior ability to innovate:</p><blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, this innovation has led to incredibly high productivity and quality of life improvements for most people, despite the ills Capitalism either didn&#39;t fix from the feudal era or invented itself. As they say, Capitalism is why we have the iPhone (as a reference to the Capitalist argument that those who critique Capitalism due so on technology only available because of Capitalism).</p><p>In practice, a lot of this historic innovation &quot;under Capitalism&quot; has actually come from state funded or academic research, including the previously cited iPhone and many of its components. The internet and GPS networks also share non-corporate origins, as do many vaccines and many other technologies. Shoot, if you include subsidies then even companies like Tesla arguably only exist because of the public, not private, sector. Even today most software relies on open-source software made freely available.</p><p>Further, as we&#39;ve reached the late stage of Capitalism, this innovation has been corrupted. Capitalist innovation is used to maximize profit, not progress. This trends towards the consolidation of wealth and the <em>reduction</em> of competition, not more. Progress becomes more incremental rather than revolutionary to minimize risk and not fundamentally change the status quo. It&#39;s instead found ways to better spy on people and optimize advertising for them. And it certainly won&#39;t innovate to find things that benefit humanity unless it can turn a profit doing so - in fact, anything that would help but at the cost of profits, like nationalizing healthcare, gets stalled thanks to lobbying.</p><p>This corrupted version of innovation is also why we now have so many new products based on nostalgia cycles and constant reboots and sequels. Everything just gets refined or repackaged, consolidating even culture over time.</p>',8),y=JSON.parse('{"title":"Innovation","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"innovation","title":"Innovation","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/innovation/index.md","filePath":"garden/innovation/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/innovation/index.md"},_=Object.assign(u,{setup(p){const o=i();return(m,f)=>(l(),a("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[s("402 words, ~2 minute read.
