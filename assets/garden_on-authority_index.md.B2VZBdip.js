It is a text acknowledging and attempting to discredit <a href="/garden/anarchism/">Anarchism</a>, arguing that authority must exist in some form.</p><blockquote><p>Thereafter particular questions arise in each room and at every moment concerning the mode of production, distribution of material, etc., which must be settled by decision of a delegate placed at the head of each branch of labour or, if possible, by a majority vote, the will of the single individual will always have to subordinate itself, which means that questions are settled in an authoritarian way.</p></blockquote><p>Engels appears to be ignorant here of group <a href="/garden/decision-making/">Decision Making</a> systems like consensus. Most anarchists would agree majoritarian rule is authoritarian, but that alternatives <em>typically</em> exist. That said, there is precedent for majoritarian rule in some anarchist societies, and I think that&#39;s fine as well. It may simply be more feasible, situationally. In this case something like work hours being decided via majority rule would likely be fine, and any individuals for whom the hours really don&#39;t work for can either be worked around or replaced. Keep in mind this is in the context of a society built upon free association and mutual aid, so the worker is not compelled to remain at this factory or indeed any factory.</p><blockquote><p>The automatic machinery of the big factory is much more despotic than the small capitalists who employ workers ever have been.</p></blockquote><p>Referring to the task of coordinating workers together as despotic feels disingenuous to me. Organizing is not inherently authoritarian. However, let&#39;s say we decide a manager is in fact required to handle deciding things like work hours. That&#39;s okay, and essentially just a form of delegation. The workers who&#39;ve decided to work at the factory would be involved in the decision making process to assign a manager, and the manager would be held accountable by those workers. As mentioned before, workers can simply not work at this factory as they are not compelled to like they would under capitalism (or indeed, a socialist but not yet communist nation). If a manager or their policies are so unpopular the factory is struggling to find willing workers, then the manager or their policies would be changed. The decision making process for that would involve surveying people who are potentially willing to join or rejoin the factory, and the process can continue until a solution can be found that is sufficiently popular. In the unlikely case a solution can&#39;t be found, if the job is important, eventually people will just agree to work under conditions they can tolerate even if they&#39;re not totally happy with to ensure the job gets done. And if no one is willing to do that, then by definition the job is not important.</p><blockquote><p>Wanting to abolish authority in large-scale industry is tantamount to wanting to abolish industry itself, to destroy the power loom in order to return to the spinning wheel.</p></blockquote><p>I disagree with this statement as per the previous notes, but even if this were the case, I think that would be fine. We had clothes back when we relied on the spinning wheel, we had food to eat before mills, etc. It would be better to be truly free than to be oppressed but more productive. People would still be incentivized to find ways to improve our productivity, and through it reduce our work days, and if they needed to find ways to do so that didn&#39;t require organization, then so be it.</p><blockquote><p>There, in time of danger, the lives of all depend on the instantaneous and absolute obedience of all to the will of one.</p></blockquote><p>Similar to the example of delegating concerns to a manager, I think appointing someone to coordinate the crew together is similarly okay. The point is that the delegation is ephemeral, the role replaceable at any time. Major decisions like where the ship is going would be the concerns of the group, but stuff like ensuring the sail is in the correct position or pulled up/down at the right times is very much able to be delegated. If there is an emergency and people need to start baling water out of the ship, that too is something someone can be put in charge of noticing and informing the rest of the crew about. It is a task to be performed, just like preparing food, mopping the decks, hoisting the anchor, etc. It is not authoritarian to have a group consensually assign a role to someone.</p><blockquote><p>When I submitted arguments like these to the most rabid anti-authoritarians, the only answer they were able to give me was the following: Yes, that&#39;s true, but there it is not the case of authority which we confer on our delegates, <em>but of a commission entrusted</em>! These gentlemen think that when they have changed the names of things they have changed the things themselves.</p></blockquote><p>It sounds like people likely brought up that delegation is not seen as an example of authoritarian rule to anarchists. But Engels does not seem to have truly engaged with their argument, if his takeaway is that they&#39;ve merely redefined the authoritarian as not authoritarian.</p><blockquote><p>We have seen, besides, that the material conditions of production and circulation inevitably develop with large-scale industry and large-scale agriculture, and increasingly tend to enlarge the scope of this authority.</p></blockquote><p>I think this still falls into conflating coordination with authority. Larger scale industry will require more coordination, sure, although not as much as he likely thinks, as a big aspect of anarchism is sustainability rather than infinite growth, so the industry would only have to grow so large before there&#39;s no point in growing further. Additionally, the growth would likely be more decentralized than he implies here. Not every cotton mill needs to coordinate with each other, and its often far more logistically practical to build more cotton mills that each independently coordinate within themselves rather than a single very large cotton mill that requires more coordination to operate. And in any case, coordination is not inherently authoritarian (but I repeat myself).</p><blockquote><p>All Socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society.</p></blockquote><p>This is not accurate to the role of the transitionary state as described by Marx and Lenin, who saw the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; as a state that would still have laws and enforcers, which the USSR did in fact have. This goes beyond the &quot;simple administrative functions&quot; that Engels refers to and which anarchists would likely agree could be delegated in a fully consensual way without sacrificing autonomy.</p><blockquote><p>But the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed.</p></blockquote><p>Actually, they believe society already has the means to ensure everyone is taken care of, and have historic evidence of being correct in this regard. That is all that is required to abolish class and with it class struggle. Honestly, I think whatever line Engels drew for when the social conditions have changed to ones compatible with communism would be a vague and shifting goalpost, inevitably perpetuating the &quot;transitionary&quot; state indefinitely.</p><blockquote><p>A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon â€” authoritarian means, if such there be at all.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, I&#39;ve actually heard this argument before! Anyways, no, I do not see liberation as an authoritarian act. It is only authoritarian if the revolutionaries aim to become the new state, as the communists wished to do and did.</p><blockquote><p>Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois?</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;ve heard this one as well, and seen anarchists refute it by arguing that it is unjust to force people to fight for a cause you cannot convince them is worth fighting for.</p><p>Overall, I don&#39;t think I really found any real arguments from Engels I agreed with. I think his reasoning against anarchists are without merit and demonstrate an unwillingness to properly engage with anarchist thought.</p>',24),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"On Authority","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"on-authority","tags":["Book"],"title":"On Authority","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/on-authority/index.md","filePath":"garden/on-authority/index.md"}'),c={name:"garden/on-authority/index.md"},w=Object.assign(c,{setup(p){const o=i();return(g,m)=>(h(),n("div",null,[l,e("p",null,[r("1401 words, ~8 minute read.
