These websites limit personalization, how you can use the website, and are filled with ads, marketers, and influencers.</p><p>The corporate web is designed for consuming content created by a few large/popular creators. This manifests in the near-ubiquitous infinitely scrolling feed of algorithmically chosen posts, optimized to keep you on the site for as long as possible, to the detriment of society.</p><p>Large websites, due to the profit motive, will naturally <a href="/garden/enshittification/">Enshittify</a>.</p><h3 id="the-old-web-was-good" tabindex="-1">The old web was good <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-old-web-was-good" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The old web was good&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In contrast to the above, the classic web was filled with many diverse sites that typically represented a single person or organization, who were able to fully tailor their site to what they wanted it to be. Websites would be more unique and interesting, since the creator would have full control over them. This also makes the whole web feel more personal and intimate, as you&#39;re looking at a closer representation of how someone chooses to portray themselves online, in a way a profile page on X or Meta cannot be.</p><p>There are still lessons we&#39;ve learned over time that can apply to modern &quot;small web&quot; pages, like accessible design and how to be more inclusive.</p><h3 id="the-small-web-is-anti-corporate" tabindex="-1">The small web is anti-corporate <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-small-web-is-anti-corporate" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The small web is anti-corporate&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Small static websites are very cheap to host, making anti-features like ads unnecessary and therefore rare. In general small websites are cheap enough to avoid needing to think about monetization entirely, let alone worrying about how to perpetually make more money. This lack of profit motive behind most small websites contributes to a culture of not just being &quot;not corporate&quot;, but &quot;anti-corporate&quot;.</p><p>In general, the corporate web seems to have values that align with those of authoritarianism - control, surveillance, and hierarchy, whereas the small web aligns with anarchist values - autonomy, cooperation, and egalitarianism.</p><h3 id="further-reading" tabindex="-1">Further reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further reading&quot;">​</a></h3><p>These are videos and articles that continue expanding on the values and motivations behind the small web as an alternative to the corporate web:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTSEr0cRJY8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">You should check out the indie web</a> (I like how this video discusses decentralization and how people are more interested in socialization rather than commodification)</li><li><a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">What is the small web?</a></li><li><a href="https://webdirections.org/blog/reweirding-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reweirding the web</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00qwzmMrtok" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The web has lost its soul</a></li></ul><h2 id="browsing-the-small-web" tabindex="-1">Browsing the small web <a class="header-anchor" href="#browsing-the-small-web" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Browsing the small web&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Follow <a href="/garden/webrings/">Webrings</a> or other links from known small websites.</p><p><a href="https://search.marginalia.nu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Marginalia</a> is a search engine for non-commercial content with a &quot;random&quot; button and filters for the small web explicitly (amongst other useful filters!)</p><p>The <a href="https://tildeverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tildeverse</a> contains a large set of personal websites.</p><ul><li>Pick one of the member sites, and they&#39;ll have a list of all their users, who each have a custom page.
