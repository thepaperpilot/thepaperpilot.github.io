I&#39;ve seen people describe the causes and effects of anti-intellectualism, but I&#39;ve noticed a lot seem to levy their critiques at aspects that I consider good ideas (specifically that relate to my ideas on a <a href="/garden/decentralized-education/">Decentralized Education</a>) that lead to a <em>more</em> educated society, not less. So here are my thoughts on anti-intellectualism&#39;s actual causes, and how to properly stop it.</p><h2 id="elitism" tabindex="-1">Elitism <a class="header-anchor" href="#elitism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Elitism&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Anti-elitism is rampant today, and for good reason. It stems from the growing realization that society is not working for a large amount of the population. Rising poverty, financial anxiety, and systemic inequality have led to a deep mistrust of &quot;the establishment&quot;, which appears to be complicit in not fixing these issues. There is a demand for a change to the status quo.</p><p>Unfortunately, this mistrust often <em>does</em> include anti-intellectualism. Specifically, public sentiment has been shaped to associate Democrats with &quot;ivory tower&quot; intellectuals who are controlling science and the media for political gain. Thus Democrats will make claims like &quot;reality having a liberal bias&quot; and make appeals to authority, and Republicans call the media &quot;fake news&quot; and suggest people need &quot;alternative facts&quot;. This dichotomy has naturally made Democrats face criticism for elitism, and thus allowed the Republicans to frame themselves as &quot;anti-establishment&quot;, even though in truth I believe both are fighting for roughly the same thing - the preservation and exaggeration of our power structures.</p><p>The two parties essentially defined a spectrum from further supporting our current education by increasing funding and making college more accessible (ostensibly the Democrat position) to believing the public education system is unrecoverably flawed and should be replaced with private education and homeschooling (the Republican position). That&#39;s made it very hard to challenge the elitism in our current education system without sounding like you&#39;re arguing for the Republican position and thus getting labelled as an anti-intellectual.</p><p>The takeaway here is that we <em>should</em> be highly critical of authority, even on things within that authority&#39;s area of expertise (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Appeal to Authority fallacy</a> and its relative controversiality). The important caveat is that being critical doesn&#39;t mean just disregarding opinions <em>because</em> they&#39;re established and it <em>definitely</em> doesn&#39;t mean we should blindly trust anyone else because they&#39;re framed themselves as &quot;anti-establishment&quot;. The Republican approach of replacing public education with private education and homeschooling is obviously about restricting access to education and allowing private schools and parents to dictate what &quot;the truth&quot; is - not actually move towards a decentralized education that supports everyone&#39;s unique perspectives.</p><h2 id="objective-truth" tabindex="-1">Objective Truth <a class="header-anchor" href="#objective-truth" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objective Truth&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I&#39;m quite critical of the idea there is an absolute, universal, objective truth. I&#39;ve explored this idea in many forms, from <a href="/garden/scientific-constructivism/">Scientific Constructivism</a>, Perspectivism, and Relativism. I&#39;ve explicitly said I believe <a href="/garden/objectivity/">Objectivity</a> is a myth. These are all fundamentally progressive ideas rooted in questioning the establishment, embracing diverse perspectives, and rejecting the status quo.</p><p>It&#39;s ironic that Republicans have become associated with &quot;alternative truths&quot; and calling out &quot;fake news&quot;, which on their surface seem to challenge the idea of an absolute, universal, objective truth. But really they do still believe in that theory of truth, they just disagree on what that truth is.</p><p>Democrats are not progressives either, and are still criticizable for their appeals to authority and clinging to established truths (although between the two, they are obviously better for at least <em>recognizing</em> things like climate change, even if they still don&#39;t properly act in that information).</p><p>The end result is that society still largely considers &quot;truth&quot; to be absolute, universal, and objective, as both ends of the political spectrum support that idea. This makes challenging that idea seem illegitimate, which in this case means framing it as &quot;anti-intellectualism&quot;.</p><h2 id="passive-learning" tabindex="-1">Passive Learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#passive-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Passive Learning&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I believe in the <a href="/garden/constructivist-theory-of-education/">Constructivist Theory of Education</a>, which argues education is not a passive process, but one that requires the student to be actively processing the information, engaging with it, and challenging their understanding of the world.</p><p>This approach to learning often means questioning what you hear from teachers to resolve conflicts with your existing understanding of the world and figure out how it all connects together. In this way, learning requires critically analyzing information, even from trusted experts in the field.</p><h2 id="diversity-creates-knowledge" tabindex="-1">Diversity Creates Knowledge <a class="header-anchor" href="#diversity-creates-knowledge" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Diversity Creates Knowledge&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Our current education sees people as specifically learners until they are &quot;caught up&quot; with the established understandings of that field, at which point they can start expanding the field through papers and other means. Your credentials in what you&#39;ve already learned or how long you&#39;ve been in the field lend credibility to your papers and claims. However, discoveries can often come from making a connection between a topic to some other idea or concept.</p><p>Additionally, our current education instills values like conformity and obedience, and essentially tries to mold students into a box. I see neurodiversity as a strength that allows us to all perceive the world and process it differently.</p><p>Both these contribute to the idea that <em>diversity</em> is important to building new knowledge, rather than an overly rigid understanding of who can contribute to a field and how. Having people all tackle the field from their own unique angle (composed of their other interests, how they process information, etc.) is more likely to contribute to further building that field, even if they haven&#39;t dedicated decades of their life to the study of that field.</p><p>That&#39;s not to say suggestions from those new to a field should just be accepted uncritically, of course. I&#39;m just arguing that those new to the field should still be able to collaborate and be seen as valid sources of new knowledge.</p><h2 id="social-media" tabindex="-1">Social Media <a class="header-anchor" href="#social-media" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Social Media&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I think this is the most interesting aspect of anti-intellectualism. We spend a lot of time on social media, and its been clearly observed that we will uncritically share information that agrees with our existing world views (e.g. confirmation bias). The spread of misinformation has been essentially unhindered, to our collective detriment. It has also led to a culture of everyone believing they are more of an expert on topics than they really are, and social media essentially positions &quot;takes&quot; next to each other as if they have the same amount of authority on the subject (with some exceptions like Quora which de-anonymize responses).</p><p>These are legitimate issues and I don&#39;t think the solution should really be forcing everyone to not be anonymous. Similarly, I think approaches like community notes have not proven to be especially effective, because of just <em>how easy</em> it is to create and share misinformation. So, I think the solution should actually be to make spreading information harder. For example, something like <a href="/garden/orchard/">Orchard</a> where instead of just being able to hit share on an article, you have to read it and engage and write your own notes on the article, and then your notes get shared rather than just the article. This should in theory still allow movements to exist as well as information that isn&#39;t just a nothing burger with a clickbait headline. I&#39;ll grant that this is largely theoretical at this point though, and why I want to make the Orchard experiment.</p><p>Beyond that, I think abolishing the <a href="/garden/profit-motive/">Profit Motive</a> will go a long way in removing the incentives for creating misinformation in the first place, which naturally will help a lot.</p><h2 id="further-reading" tabindex="-1">Further Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further Reading&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo0M3H1QsEQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Right-Wing War on Education</a> connects the anti-intellectualism from the right and how it ties into supporting <a href="/garden/individualism/">Individualism</a> and reinforcing the status quo.
