But being conscious of it is important, because otherwise you&#39;ll just end up implicitly supporting the current power structures created and maintained by the political status quo, which in the US currently means capitalism, patriarchy, and white supremacy. Our society has guided us towards considering much of it as apolitical apart from a small number of contentious issues. This has led to some people describing themselves or their actions as &quot;apolitical&quot;, and in some cases even take pride in their avoidance of what they consider political topics.</p><p>However, because <em>everything</em> is political, &quot;apoliticism&quot; is a misleading term. Being &quot;apolitical&quot; really means being resistant to change, implicitly supporting the status quo. That is, an &quot;apolitical&quot; person could also be considered a reactionary or counter-revolutionary. It <em>is</em> taking a stance, in favor of preserving any existing power structures. Essentially, if you believe politics don&#39;t effect you, that&#39;s probably because the current political and economic systems work in your favor. Because even apoliticism is taking a stance, its fair to say there is no such thing as <a href="/garden/objectivity/">Objectivity</a>.</p><h2 id="everything-is-political" tabindex="-1">Everything is Political <a class="header-anchor" href="#everything-is-political" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Everything is Political&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We live in a society dictated by capitalism, and it has infiltrated not only our markets but every aspect of our lives. We all know when you buy an apple from the store not all of it goes to the workers; it&#39;s putting some amount of money in capitalists&#39; pockets and further accumulating wealth at the top of the hierarchy. We know the prices are only as low as they are due to the exploitation of workers all around the world working in horrible conditions for horrible pay. We know the company we buy from is organized like a totalitarian regime where all the decisions come from up high and serve to benefit those at the top. So why isn&#39;t buying an apple political?</p><p>Engaging in our market economy is both a necessity for our survival, and normalized through decades and decades of propaganda and reinforcement of the status quo. We become alienated to the effects of our actions as a defense measure because our daily complicity in various atrocities are simply too grand to carry on our shoulders. It becomes apolitical out of necessity. This has a side effect of making all challenges to the status quo (progressivism) appear far more controversial and political than just keeping things as they are.</p><p>With so many things becoming commodified, this effect becomes stronger with time. Our culture, love, attention have all been commodified. Everything being for sale means politics affects everything. It becomes increasingly difficult to argue anything involving purchasing things, consuming things (including media), or just learning about things in general, like history, can be apolitical.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/X_234m1zGf4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Search For The Apolitical Video Game</a> goes over this idea through the framework of searching for an &quot;apolitical&quot; video game, as a response to the common rhetoric from &quot;anti-woke&quot; people asking to &quot;keep politics out of games&quot;. The arguments they make for video games trivially apply to all forms of media.</p><h2 id="negative-vs-positive-peace" tabindex="-1">Negative vs Positive Peace <a class="header-anchor" href="#negative-vs-positive-peace" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Negative vs Positive Peace&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A motivation behind apoliticism is seeking to limit conflict. However, absence of conflict is what MLK Jr. described as a &quot;negative peace&quot;, arguing for instead a &quot;positive peace&quot;, which he defined as the presence of justice. Those fighting for negative and positive peace will naturally disagree and disrupt each other. For example, a violent protest could be opposed by those seeking a negative peace, whereas it may be seen as necessary for change by someone seeking a positive peace.</p><p>Ostensibly, both sides are arguing for peace, and the differing terms can lead to confusion and strife. Ultimately I believe we should fight for a positive peace until we live in a truly just society. But until that change actually occurs, those fighting for positive peace are going to be causing conflict without much gain.</p><p>This contradiction between the two types of peace leads to the status quo being &quot;sticky&quot;, and more likely to change in an instant via revolution than over time via reform. <a href="/garden/nicky-case/">Nicky Case</a> explores this concept in her project, <a href="https://ncase.me/attractors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Attractor Landscapes</a>.</p><h2 id="anti-woke" tabindex="-1">&quot;Anti-woke&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#anti-woke" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&quot;Anti-woke&quot;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One of the most significant examples of apoliticism is the &quot;anti-woke&quot; crowd. These are a group of online users across various platforms that decry progressive politics being introduced into media (especially media related to &quot;nerdy&quot; hobbies, like movies, games, and comics). However, while framing their intent as wanting to &quot;keep politics out of games/movies/etc.&quot;, they&#39;ll typically be referring specifically to things like diverse representation. This has been made fun of by suggesting the two genders are &quot;male&quot; and &quot;political&quot;, two races &quot;white&quot; and &quot;political&quot;, etc.</p><p>When discussing what media is <em>not</em> considered woke, they&#39;ve often recommended things that are very overtly political, letting things slide if they reinforce conservative values or include fan service or power fantasies. And sometimes they just ignore the politics and call games non-woke because they&#39;re good games, like Metal Gear Solid. I recommend browsing <a href="https://wokedetector.cirnoslab.me/full-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Woke Detector</a> to see what games have been considered not woke and what ridiculous reasons games have been added to that list for.</p><h2 id="apolitical-news" tabindex="-1">Apolitical News <a class="header-anchor" href="#apolitical-news" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Apolitical News&quot;">​</a></h2><p><span id="66359125-e263-4a17-b1db-f3b9df9602c0">Sometimes people will discuss the news, including deeply political topics, and try to claim they are giving a fair and unbiased reporting. This is already a difficult task, but often even when it seems to be upheld, it ends up just reinforcing the status quo and current societal values.</span></p><p>For example, when reporting about the US&#39; role in Israel&#39;s genocide against Palestinians, not taking a stance actively against the genocide is implicit support for the genocide to continue, the default state. This is not to say everyone must be an activist on every issue, but that <em>intentionally</em> not taking a side when trying to inform people about the issue is akin to endorsing the status quo and arguing against change.</p><p>Less principled news stations, such as various youtube channels, won&#39;t even make meaningful effort to remain unbiased anyways, yet still pre-emptively defend themselves by hiding behind an &quot;apolitical&quot; label. For example Omni, a youtuber who reports on online drama, made an apology for their handling of a controversy between an &quot;anti-woke&quot; youtuber called &quot;Think Before You Sleep&quot; and their harassment target &quot;illymation&quot;, where they essentially only covered TBYS&#39; side. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2KkoAk1_HA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">apology</a> is pre-empted by claiming to be apolitical and not taking a side, but once again gives uneven coverage in favor of TBYS.</p><h2 id="r-nonpoliticaltwitter" tabindex="-1">r/NonPoliticalTwitter <a class="header-anchor" href="#r-nonpoliticaltwitter" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;r/NonPoliticalTwitter&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This is a subreddit that claims to only allow non-political content. Naturally, this is a good case study to argue why the concept of non-political content doesn&#39;t exist. They have an interesting interpretation of politics, wherein content can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NonPoliticalTwitter/comments/1asphum/addressing_the_community_regarding_the_no/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">even involve political figures</a>, if the focus of the post isn&#39;t considered political. This leads to one of the top posts at the time of writing being about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NonPoliticalTwitter/comments/1fu46li/lost_in_translation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Jimmy Carter giving a speech in Japan</a>. So its a post about a US president engaging in politics abroad, but the post focuses on how an interpreter handled a joke, so it&#39;s not political. There&#39;s naturally no discussion on why Carter was in Japan or putting this event in a broader context of the relationship between the US and Japan after WW2 and Carter&#39;s role in repairing it.</p><p>Even when they don&#39;t involve US presidents, nearly every post on that subreddit can be associated with politics. Complaining about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NonPoliticalTwitter/comments/1foaezt/anyone_know_if_this_works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">subscription costs </a> and how support agents can reduce the prices to keep you from leaving is apolitical, as is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NonPoliticalTwitter/comments/1g1e8ph/what_do_they_put_in_those_things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">discussing how childrens cereal is so unhealthy ants disregard it as food</a>.

These <em>are</em> political issues, and they&#39;re only able to pass as apolitical by maintaining a lack of awareness on how politics shape society.</p><h2 id="randy-fine" tabindex="-1">Randy Fine <a class="header-anchor" href="#randy-fine" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Randy Fine&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Randy is a US senator who is trying to ban &quot;politically partisan flags&quot;, such as the pride flag or BLM flag, from government buildings.
