It&#39;s also increasingly becoming how we discover and discuss news and ideas. It&#39;s incredibly important, but flawed. A lot of pages in this digital garden criticize and attempt to solve these flaws.</p><p>Traditional social media is centralized, meaning you have to trust the central authority to be acting in your best interests. It also means you likely won&#39;t have control over the moderation rules, sorting methods, filters, or other aspects of the platform. Traditional social media is also overrun by entities trying to accumulate wealth in the &quot;attention economy&quot;, meaning feeds are littered with influencers, advertisers, and scams. It&#39;s not a safe place to be and its not conducive to health conversations.</p><p><a href="/garden/fediverse/">Federated Social Media</a> is partially <a href="/garden/decentralized/">Decentralized</a>, and includes services like Mastodon or Lemmy. These require self hosting, leading to it being a federation of smaller centralized authorities. Most people still won&#39;t have control over the platform, but may find a platform that&#39;s more tolerable to them. However, the process of doing so greatly increases the barrier of entry into the network, and stifles their adoption.</p><p>I personally advocate for a full decentralized social media, called the <a href="/garden/fedi-v2/">Agentic Fediverse</a> .
