My personal belief is that we learn best when we&#39;re intrinsically motivated to learn something, and will find the way to learn that material that works best for us. The motivation will ensure that no matter the method, we&#39;ll be actively engaged in learning, and that is the key to ensuring we learn best. This would likely entail a fully <a href="/garden/decentralized-education/">Decentralized Education</a> in order to be practical.</p><p>The methods students can end up using to learn the material will be very diverse, and not just not fall into three over-simplistic categories. For example, take game design: I could see equally valid approaches where someone starts a small project to experiment with some game design idea or theory they have, whereas someone else might focus on waxing philosophical about the theory with others first. It has far less to do with whether you&#39;re reading, listening, or touching anything; it&#39;s all about approaching a new topic in a way that interests and motivates that person specifically.</p><h3 id="neurodiversity" tabindex="-1">Neurodiversity <a class="header-anchor" href="#neurodiversity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Neurodiversity&quot;">​</a></h3><p>By abolishing these rigid preconceptions on how people learn, this system also works better for neurodivergent individuals, who are often failed by our current system that tries to mold them into the shape of a neurotypical individual, or rather what the system <em>thinks</em> a neurotypical person looks like. In truth I don&#39;t think there really is any one box that could be considered &quot;typical&quot;. People who are &quot;close enough&quot; to society&#39;s view of a &quot;neurotypical&quot; person get lumped in that box, and everyone else in a single &quot;neurodivergent&quot; box. I think we should be thinking of people&#39;s unique approaches to processing information and engaging with the world as a diverse spectrum without any boxes or presumptions of what&#39;s &quot;typical&quot;.</p><p>Ultimately this neurodiversity <em>helps</em> our collective body of knowledge, and that fact should normalize and destigmatize people learning in whatever way works best for them. Not stifling this diversity and creativity is a major justification for rejecting grades and rigid curricula.</p><h4 id="short-form-content" tabindex="-1">Short-Form Content <a class="header-anchor" href="#short-form-content" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Short-Form Content&quot;">​</a></h4><p>There&#39;s been a recent bias against short-form content, arguing that it &quot;causes&quot; ADHD by pointing to an increasing amount of diagnoses. I suspect it is not &quot;causing&quot; ADHD, but rather allowing people for whom that style of content is more engaging to be more open about that fact, rather than feeling forced to mold themselves into the box of &quot;neurotypical&quot;.</p><p>In that way it&#39;s similar to how destigmatizing left handedness caused an uptick in the amount of people who are openly left handed. If anything, the uptick in diagnoses just indicates that what we&#39;ve as a society defined as &quot;neurotypical&quot; is not that typical after all.</p><p>That said, there has been <em>some</em> studies linking screentime to certain brain activity associated with ADHD. Correlation doesn&#39;t equal causation and I think that study could still be compatible with the conclusions I&#39;ve drawn here, but if it turns out that changing social media to prevent unhealthy behaviors like doomscrolling also reduces the amount of people with ADHD, then I think that&#39;s ultimately still just a neutral change. Mental health simply hasn&#39;t been studied nearly to the extent it deserves to be.</p>',12),w=JSON.parse('{"title":"Learning Styles","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"learning-styles","tags":["Education"],"title":"Learning Styles","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/learning-styles/index.md","filePath":"garden/learning-styles/index.md"}'),c={name:"garden/learning-styles/index.md"},b=Object.assign(c,{setup(p){const a=i();return(m,g)=>(l(),o("div",null,[h,e("p",null,[s("498 words, ~3 minute read.
