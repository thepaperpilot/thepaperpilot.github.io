This is not sufficient though, as it still means people would need to be exposed to the bad content before being able to block it, and it does nothing to combat the spread of misinformation.</p><p>For specifically tackling the problem of keeping fascism out of a community, I recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/P55t6eryY3g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this video</a> (and the whole series) by Innuendo Studios.</p><h2 id="approaches" tabindex="-1">Approaches <a class="header-anchor" href="#approaches" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Approaches&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="labelers" tabindex="-1">Labelers <a class="header-anchor" href="#labelers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Labelers&quot;">​</a></h3><p><a href="/garden/atproto/">ATProto</a> designed a system of labelers that anyone can create and follow. Labeling services mark accounts or posts as NSFW, gore, etc. These will cause the post to either be hidden entirely or obscured until the user clicks through a warning. These labelers can be configured by the app designer or the user themselves. The labelers can be linked to reporting services or setup to label based on arbitrary criteria, such as sending each reported post to an LLM for judgement.</p><p>I have several concerns with this system. Firstly, these labelers are likely to accumulate influence as the popular ones get used more and thus become more popular. This centralizes power. Also, sites like clearsky just show a list of lists a user has been placed on. If a list has strong language not backed up by rigorous verification, for example a list that claims to only contain pedophiles that in practice is just people the list creator dislikes, it will unjustly mar people&#39;s reputation.</p><p>The second concern is with malicious labelers. If a labeler decides to create a list of people known to be a member of a specific marginalized community, there&#39;s little to no action anyone can do to stop it. While such lists can be used to help members of that community find each other, it can absolutely be used maliciously, effectively allowing -phobes to share a public target list with impunity.</p><p>Lastly, this is moderation through the use of blocklists. This isn&#39;t inherently bad, but it&#39;s a double edged sword, as I discuss <a href="/garden/moderation/#674531bb-952c-4346-8f0d-febf15e24879">here</a>.</p><p><span id="67525178-9f33-400c-9452-0a60d5e0f3a0"><h3><a href="/garden/network-of-vouches/">Network of Vouches</a></h3></span></p><p>A network that relies on individuals vouching for each other being human or otherwise trusted could allow clients to filter out any untrusted sources. Clients could customize the topography of this network by configuring things like max chain of vouches allowed. A new user would need to find an initial friend before they can meaningfully engage with the platform, though.</p><h3 id="digital-locality" tabindex="-1"><a href="/garden/digital-locality/">Digital Locality</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#digital-locality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Digital Locality](/garden/digital-locality/index.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Similar to the network of vouches, a network with digital locality naturally limits the amount of content you&#39;ll see, essentially eliminating bots and spam as well as organically filtering the content you see based on the people you interact with. It would also limit the spread of content considered harmful, because people wouldn&#39;t want to attach it to their public identity but any new identity wouldn&#39;t be part of a network of connections. Notably, this system would not oppress things for just being part of a different culture or value set, since in that case there would still be others to connect with that feel the same way. To more thoroughly prevent the harmful behavior, you&#39;ll likely need to fix issues <em>outside</em> of social media as well.</p><h3 id="proof-of-work" tabindex="-1">Proof of work <a class="header-anchor" href="#proof-of-work" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Proof of work&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If interacting with a person, such as tagging them, replying, or reacting, &quot;cost&quot; the user by requiring them to solve an expensive cryptography challenge, that could make bot farms infeasible while not significantly impacting normal users.</p><p>For normal users, you&#39;d just have a queue of messages being sent - an outbox. Once the challenge is passed, the message sends. Since the user is interacting at human speeds, it shouldn&#39;t ever become too large.</p><p>For bots, sending those messages out quickly to a lot of people will cost an enormous amount of resources, making it infeasible.</p><p>In theory this system should be customizable, where a user can change the difficulty of the challenge based on groups of people (e.g. people you follow, or are within a chain of followers) as well as per action taken. It should be able to completely disable challenges for certain users or in contexts like replying to you in a thread where you&#39;ve already replied to them.</p><p>The challenges could theoretically be for something useful, rather than just meaningless busywork. For example, hooking this up to Folding@Home or SETI@Home. There&#39;s already work being done to enable PoW calculations to have additional utility, and I believe it should be easier for something like this where the challenge is completely arbitrary rather than something like a blockchain where you also need to be hashing the state of the chain.</p>',23),y=JSON.parse('{"title":"Decentralized Moderation","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"tags:: Decentralized","slug":"decentralized-moderation","title":"Decentralized Moderation","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/decentralized-moderation/index.md","filePath":"garden/decentralized-moderation/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/decentralized-moderation/index.md"},w=Object.assign(u,{setup(p){const t=i();return(m,f)=>(l(),r("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[n("796 words, ~4 minute read.
