On traditional social media, this refers to how influencers and advertisers will have their content spread, but also specific posts from smaller posters can get picked up by the algorithm and spread as well.</p><p>Since there&#39;s only so much of people&#39;s attention to go around, social media has been described as an &quot;attention economy&quot;. Under this framework, one could argue that social media is designed for &quot;wealth accumulation&quot;, elevating a handful of accounts to celebrity status and limiting the reach of the masses. This dynamic much reflects the class antagonisms in a capitalist economy.</p><h2 id="non-consensual-virality" tabindex="-1">Non-consensual virality <a class="header-anchor" href="#non-consensual-virality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Non-consensual virality&quot;">​</a></h2><p>On traditional social media, posts can be picked up by the algorithm and spread far and wide, causing the author to be inundated with unwanted attention, including negative or hateful attention.

This means they have to &quot;jump&quot; between instances (or escape, as he refers to it) in order to spread. This makes the movement much harder to spread across the federated network.</p><p>This may be solved by more properly <a href="/garden/decentralized-social-media/">Decentralized Social Media</a>, since without a concept of instances there would naturally no longer be instance-local hashtags. Decentralized moderation would also give more agency to individuals, who can then participate in movements on a case-by-case basis rather than the instance potentially making that decision for them.</p>',11),y=JSON.parse('{"title":"Virality","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"virality","title":"Virality","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/virality/index.md","filePath":"garden/virality/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/virality/index.md"},b=Object.assign(u,{setup(p){const t=o();return(m,f)=>(l(),n("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[s("324 words, ~2 minute read.
