They believe the ideal society is somewhere &quot;in the middle&quot;, with compromise and taking aspects from all political perspectives, or at least some subset. This is, in my opinion, an erroneous belief that the center has some special value that makes it better than the extremes. In practice, centrists fight for the status quo as defined by things like materialism and the Overton window.</p><blockquote><p>When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together. - Isaac Asimov</p></blockquote><h2 id="midpoints" tabindex="-1">Midpoints <a class="header-anchor" href="#midpoints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Midpoints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Most issues are not able to be properly split down the middle, and the way the endpoints, and therefore midpoint, are defined is often political in and of itself. Nowhere is this more clear than on issues of injustice. There is no midpoint between fixing injustice and not, and any resistance to fixing the injustice in whole is not an apolitical or centrist position - it&#39;s siding with the oppressors.</p><p>For example, take the genocide of Palestine: Naturally, no one is arguing for a midpoint of only ethnically cleansing <em>half</em> of Palestine, or that we should merely cut the funding in half. The centrist position is, I suppose, supporting a ceasefire but maintaining the open air prison that has been oppressing Palestine for generations and is the underlying reason for this and previous conflict.</p><p>There&#39;s no reason to believe that that midpoint is more virtuous than one that <em>fully solves the conflict</em> by liberating Palestine. In the same way that when slavery was &quot;abolished&quot;, the power structures that oppressed African Americans in America was preserved, and in fact slavery was allowed to continue (as it does to this day) for anyone currently in prison - which naturally is a population disproportionately African American.</p><p>On other issues too, midpoints don&#39;t often make sense. In the spectrum of pro-forced birth and pro-choice, there are various centrist positions arguing for a cut off at various arbitrary points along the pregnancy process. That at some points the fetus&#39; life takes precedence over the pregnant person&#39;s, but not others. That at some points the pregnant person should be allowed agency over their body, but not others. In practice, any qualifiers to when a pregnant person can have an abortion leads to doctors having to delay and in some cases even deny medically necessary care, all under the belief that there is some large number of pregnant people willing to carry their baby to 8 or 9 months, only to abort it without a <em>very</em> good reason. The correct position should be to always allow abortion, and to ensure it can be done quickly and safely. All midpoints are restricting bodily autonomy and leading to preventable deaths.</p><p>Another example midpoint is with regards to trans rights. Progressives are in favor of trans rights, however centrists are getting hung up on the specific issue over <a href="/garden/trans-athletes-in-sports/">Trans athletes in sports</a>.</p><h2 id="fighting-change" tabindex="-1">Fighting Change <a class="header-anchor" href="#fighting-change" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fighting Change&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum—even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there&#39;s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate. - Noam Chomsky</p></blockquote><p>Centrists may hold certain political opinions on things that could be changed for the better, but in their fight against extremism they often end up resisting that change. They&#39;ll fight for relatively incremental change, achieved through the established democratic process through which our voices can be heard. They&#39;ll hold that view even in cases where the democratic process wouldn&#39;t be fast enough or lacks viable candidates to vote for that agree with the public on all or even many issues.</p><h3 id="abolishing-power-structures" tabindex="-1">Abolishing Power Structures <a class="header-anchor" href="#abolishing-power-structures" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Abolishing Power Structures&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The issue with incremental change is that a lot of issues are caused by systemic issues that need revolutionary change. Our existing power structures are <em>deeply</em> entrenched, and the problems caused by, say, capitalism, are not going to be fixed through incremental reform. In fact, throughout history you can see that there have been times of increased regulation and attempts to limit the power and influence of the wealthy. However, since wealth <em>is</em> power, these reforms have steadily been rolled back, if not prevented outright. Having a power imbalance will inevitably lead to those in power further consolidating power, and the only way to prevent that is to abolish the power structure entirely.</p><p>Even if centrists successfully pushed for incremental reform and got us all the way to, say, market socialism, I wouldn&#39;t count on those policies remaining in place indefinitely. Either the powerful would chip away at those policies, or a revolution would occur and finally shift the government more fully to the left.</p><h3 id="palestine" tabindex="-1">Palestine <a class="header-anchor" href="#palestine" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Palestine&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A good example is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/22/us/gaza-war-campuses-middle-ground.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this article</a> over centrists on the genocide of Palestine. They take the view I mentioned earlier that there should be a ceasefire, but beyond that differ in whether they believe Israel has a right to exist and what liberation for Palestine would look like.</p><p>This group of centrists is unified in their disapproval of how &quot;both sides&quot; attack each other. For example, a professor at UCLA is quoted in the article as saying he wanted to make a space for discussion of the conflict &quot;that was neither pro-Israel, nor anti-Israel, but one that allowed for students from whatever their perspective, whatever their background, to come and learn and ask questions&quot;. Essentially, saying that the oppressors and oppressed should come together to better understand the other side and work out their differences. I suspect if this was a different issue but with the same power imbalance, such as rape, he would not be arguing that the rapist and the raped should come together to learn each other&#39;s side and work out their differences.</p><p>That article also discusses how many of them consider themselves pacifists and use that reasoning for both supporting the ceasefire but also opposing violent protests or those who find Hamas justified in any way. They, evidently, do not find armed resistance against one&#39;s oppressors to be justified. To be clear, I&#39;m not saying we should support acts of terrorism in the general sense, or that Hamas is some perfect institution that could do no wrong, but I reject the centrist notion that fighting against one&#39;s oppressors cannot be justified or that its as wrong as the oppression they&#39;re resisting. That a slave shouldn&#39;t fight back against their master. That someone shouldn&#39;t fight back against their kidnapper, etc. Sure it&#39;d be great for none of this violence to occur, but you don&#39;t accomplish world peace by equating the violence done by the oppressor with the violence done by the oppressed, or by equating injustice with the protests against said injustice.</p><h2 id="moral-superiority" tabindex="-1">Moral Superiority <a class="header-anchor" href="#moral-superiority" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Moral Superiority&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><div class="img-container"><img src="'+h+'" title="atheists.png"></div> &#39;But you&#39;re using that same tactic to try to feel superior to me, too!&#39; &#39;Sorry, that accusation expires after one use per conversation.&#39; \\- Randall Munroe </blockquote><p>Politics have become very core parts of our identity, once again in large part due to the intentional polarization done by the political system of turning every issue into an adversarial &quot;us vs them&quot; fight where you need to support your side and attack the other without consideration. Attacks on our political opinions become attacks on our identity and self worth, which does not make for good, healthy debate.</p><p>But, to be clear, I&#39;m doing it to! The same way enlightened centrists have found a way to feel superior to both Democrats and Republicans (or rather, believe that they hold the reasonable or pragmatic viewpoint), I&#39;m over here doing the same thing to all 3 groups! I&#39;m still making a &quot;both sides&quot; argument, just from the perspective that both sides (and those who see those two sides as extremes) are all too far to the right. Of course, I have what I feel are legitimate arguments to <em>why</em> we should move to the left and <em>why</em> both sides are really right wing, but it&#39;s important to not adopt the same air of superiority I&#39;m criticizing centrists for having.</p><p>I personally do believe people can learn and change their minds, as <a href="/garden/my-political-journey/">I certainly have</a>, and that people shouldn&#39;t be discredited for their political beliefs. We&#39;re all on our own journeys, and it&#39;s a good idea to just encourage divorcing self worth from the &quot;correctness&quot; of our pre-conceived political opinions, so we can be more open to other views. Not just Democrats vs Republicans, but beyond that very limited spectrum as well. I really think most Americans could likely be convinced on the merits of <em>at least</em> <a href="/garden/market-socialism/">Market Socialism</a>, and many even further left than that, if they listened to the arguments for it.</p><h3 id="aesthetics-and-civility" tabindex="-1">Aesthetics and Civility <a class="header-anchor" href="#aesthetics-and-civility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Aesthetics and Civility&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I believe part of the appeal of adopting (or at least being close to) the &quot;moderate and rational&quot; position is that they can theoretically &quot;fit in&quot; with both sides. They want to bridge the gap, and demonstrate that once you get the extremists out, we&#39;re not all that different. In this regard, they&#39;re really arguing for <em>civility</em>. Suppressing the extremes is their form of ensuring everyone &quot;gets along&quot;.</p><p>But here&#39;s the thing: demanding civility is a tool of the status quo. The state performed and continues to perform <em>enormous</em> amounts of violence, but portrays violence against it as uncivil as a way of control and self-preservation. It is, in fact, morally justifiable to be <em>extremely</em> passionate and uncivil about genocide and other preventable deaths. About people having the rights over their own body stripped away. About systemic oppression preventing them from having access to opportunities granted to others.</p><p>The centrists I&#39;m talking about here are the ones calling for rational or civil discussion and regularly call out things like swearing or other forms of impassioned protest as the &quot;wrong way&quot; to make sure your voice is heard. Or arguing that there&#39;s a &quot;free market of ideas&quot; and that cancelling or otherwise punishing people for saying harmful things is wrong.</p><blockquote><p>I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice - Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote><h2 id="overton-window" tabindex="-1">Overton Window <a class="header-anchor" href="#overton-window" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Overton Window&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says &quot;Morning, boys. How&#39;s the water?&quot; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes &quot;What the hell is water?&quot; - David Foster Wallace</p></blockquote><p>The Overton window refers to how there&#39;s a range of acceptable opinions within a society. Specifically, Overton argues that this window is a fuzzy and moving window, that is essentially invisible to those within it. This is aligned with the idea of materialism, which argues that our environment shapes our ideas. That also means that changing our environment will change our ideas, or shift the Overton window. Naturally, as a leftist, I find the opinions currently outside the Overton window to the left to be sound ideas, so my goal is to help shift the window in that direction, through engaging in political discourse, direct action, etc.</p><p>Fundamentally, the <em>existence</em> of the Overton window implies something very important: the range of acceptable opinion is not some objective truth, but in fact rather arbitrary. Ideas outside the Overton window, such as public ownership of the means of production, are not inherently illegitimate ideas, we&#39;re just predisposed to thinking it is because of how &quot;sticky&quot; the status quo is.</p><p>Centrists will often label themselves relative to some perceived midpoint, e.g. &quot;center&quot; or &quot;left of center&quot;. Being left or right of center <em>typically</em> means they still see a range of acceptable political opinions that excludes extreme/radical stances, but their personal beliefs just happen to skew a certain direction. They&#39;re still reinforcing the Overton window and the status quo it represents. They see the current system as a baseline to compromise with and only change incrementally.</p><p>This resistance to change comes with an idea that our current society is at the more or less correct state it should be in. This, ironically enough, means viewing every previous civil rights movement as justified and validated by history, but viewing whatever ones are currently in progress as bad. This has led to the leftist critique against liberals that &quot;liberals support every civil rights movement except the current one, and oppose every war except the current one.&quot;</p><h3 id="republicans-and-democrats-are-not-opposites" tabindex="-1">Republicans and Democrats are not Opposites <a class="header-anchor" href="#republicans-and-democrats-are-not-opposites" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Republicans and Democrats are not Opposites&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In America, the Overton window can loosely be defined by the range from the Democrat platform and the Republican platform. This window is in constant motion, but there&#39;s a distinct rightwards trend caused by the ratchet effect, and certain ideas, like the overall structure of our government, economy, and society, are not challenged. That&#39;s why there&#39;s never a viable candidate with a platform of leftist policies like nationalizing industries, defunding the police, instituting a UBI, etc.</p><p>The range of acceptable opinions hasn&#39;t just been reinforced through decades of political messaging, its also been polarized. Despite the differences between the two parties still being quite right leaning overall (and increasingly so), people have been conditioned into thinking that both parties are radical extremes and whatever party you&#39;re not in is evil. This conditioning has helped cement the two parties and has been leveraged as a weapon against each other.</p><p>During the 2024 elections, Trump was able to get away with calling Kamala a communist despite her being a neoliberal capitalist. <em>Actual</em> communists are so far outside the window, and the range of acceptable opinion so well reinforced, that just being in the Democratic party is enough for people to believe someone is communist. The perception of communists has been altered from &quot;those who seek a transitionary state where the public owns the means of production that has the overall goal to get us to a classless, stateless, moneyless society&quot; to just anyone who supports basic welfare. For Kamala, her &quot;communist&quot; policies were things like tax breaks for families with children, price controls on groceries, and cash incentives to first-time home buyers.</p><h2 id="nuance" tabindex="-1">Nuance <a class="header-anchor" href="#nuance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Nuance&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Supporting radical ideas does not mean lacking nuance, and supporting centrism does not mean having a nuanced take. Centrism only cares about avoiding extremes, whereas radicals can still have a nuanced understanding of political theory that helped them arrive at a given extreme.</p><p>I don&#39;t want this section to just be me patting leftists on the back, but suffice to say radicals at the very least are able to defend their position from their understanding of history, power dynamics, ethical principles, and systemic analysis.</p><p>In comparison, arguing that extremes are <em>inherently</em> bad is actually a very non-nuanced position.</p><h2 id="horseshoe-theory" tabindex="-1">Horseshoe Theory <a class="header-anchor" href="#horseshoe-theory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Horseshoe Theory&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Horseshoe theory is a pro-centrism theory that states that the far right (which it defines as fascism) and far left (which it defines as communism) are more similar to each other than the center of the spectrum. In case you weren&#39;t aware, horseshoe theory is largely disregarded in contemporary political science as a gross oversimplification. A book on this topic that I have on my &quot;to be read&quot; list is Parenti&#39;s <a href="https://archive.org/details/michael-parenti-blackshirts-and-reds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Blackshirts and Reds</a>.</p><p>The left is in favor of abolishing capitalism <em>because</em> its an oppressive hierarchy, making it inherently anti-authoritarian. That holds true even if certain factions believe in the necessity of a transitionary state to bring us to a society fully liberated of class, money, and yes even state. The right, regardless of if a specific faction wants ethno-states or laissez faire capitalism (i.e. capitalism with a minimal or even non-existent state), are supportive of oppressive power structures.</p><p>I believe horseshoe theory ultimately serves to obscure the similarities between the US and the nations its criticizing. By implying the oppressive nature of the USSR and Nazi Germany governments are caused by their extreme economic ideologies, the US frames itself as lacking that oppressive nature by adopting what it frames as a moderate and rational middle-ground. However, it still has a history of expansionism, systemic racism, and suppression of dissent that disproves that notion. Of course, that&#39;s also implying the US doesn&#39;t have an increasingly extreme right wing economy anyways.</p><p>In any case, I think rather than arguing horseshoe theory is correct, its better to just say states, regardless of economic ideology or whether or not they&#39;re a liberal democracy, can be authoritarian... which was probably already obvious and not all that insightful.</p><h2 id="further-reading" tabindex="-1">Further Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#further-reading" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Further Reading&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmhLCy6YmUg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Destiny and the Liberal Mind Prison</a></p>',51),w=JSON.parse('{"title":"Centrism","description":"","frontmatter":{"alias":"Centrist","public":"true","slug":"centrism","title":"Centrism","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/centrism/index.md","filePath":"garden/centrism/index.md"}'),p={name:"garden/centrism/index.md"},v=Object.assign(p,{setup(m){const a=i();return(g,f)=>(r(),o("div",null,[c,e("p",null,[s("2830 words, ~15 minute read.
