It would be self guided, self paced, and mastery focused rather than using grades to coerce students into learning subjects they find uninteresting and unimportant. This process means everyone shares the role of both teacher and student rather than one or the other, and the process of learning becomes a collaborative and interactive process where all participants are heavily engaged.</p><p>Sometimes this term gets used to describe American education, because there is no national standardized curriculum. I do not consider this accurate, for much the same reason I don&#39;t consider federations to be decentralized. Having multiple centers doesn&#39;t avoid the issues of centralization, and true decentralization is when there are <em>no</em> centers. Barring that, it should have each &quot;center&quot; be as small and autonomous as possible - not on the scale of entire states or even entire school districts. But again: ideally, fully decentralized by being based on individual relationships and interactions between people.</p><h2 id="curriculum" tabindex="-1">Curriculum <a class="header-anchor" href="#curriculum" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Curriculum&quot;">​</a></h2><p>People would teach and learn things they consider interesting or important (which means they&#39;d be following <a href="/garden/motivation/">Intrinsic Motivation</a> rather than extrinsic). This helps transfer culture and values between generations while also ensuring the &quot;curriculum&quot; doesn&#39;t force people to learn things the society has already determined outdated or not important.</p><p>It should typically be clear when concepts have pre-requisites, so concepts we today might consider important foundation concepts like math and science would still get taught, but within the context of a person&#39;s interests as the ultimate goal, rather than just being told its important for everyone to know some concept without any real justification. For example, if someone is interested in game development it&#39;ll quickly become apparent they&#39;ll need to know logic and reasoning, and certain aspects of game development will require their own pre-requisite skills, such as a movement system requiring knowledge of vectors, normalization, and likely some trigonometry.</p><p>The important part of this is that people&#39;s natural curiosity and interests guide the education, and anything that isn&#39;t considered useful or important enough to learn is, in fact, not useful or important. If someone simply isn&#39;t interested in healthcare never learns the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell... that&#39;s okay. There&#39;s others who are interested and will learn that. If there weren&#39;t enough people who are into healthcare to ensure a healthy society, then more people will as a direct result become <em>very</em> interested in healthcare, for the sake of society. For another example, if an entire society decides that some concept is just no longer important, like ranching after the world becomes vegan, then there&#39;d be no one to teach it but only because there&#39;s no need. Ranching would no longer be necessary or desired, and the skill would die out. That&#39;s fine, neither it nor any other piece of information is truly some objective &quot;everyone must know this&quot; or even &quot;some number of people must know this&quot;. Different areas of the world would likely have different cultures and values that dictate what topics are considered useful or important as well, and it&#39;s a feature (not a bug) to not force the same standardized curriculum across all cultures.</p><p>My focus on decentralized education as something that gives students more autonomy does not mean I&#39;m shifting the responsibility of learning onto the individual. Ultimately I&#39;m still describing a communal collaborative process where everyone influences each other on what is interesting or useful enough to learn. This is a <em>social</em> responsibility, not individual. The distinction here is important because it&#39;s celebrates each individuals&#39; unique interests and strengths, without treating them like they failed for not conforming to some standardized set of expectations.</p><h3 id="the-role-of-the-internet" tabindex="-1">The Role of the Internet <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-role-of-the-internet" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Role of the Internet&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now of course, it wouldn&#39;t <em>actually</em> be possible for information to die out, since books and the internet exist and are likely to continue to exist for the foreseeable future. Those would also mean that it&#39;s okay if you have an interest that no one else is knowledgeable on a topic you have an interest in. In addition to your local community, you&#39;re also a part of the global village via the internet, and there will obviously be plenty of resources and ways to connect with others interested in those topics that way.</p><p>It&#39;s a bit trickier to learn when you can&#39;t get hands on experience, but its more than enough for a lot of people and a lot of topics, at least enough to determine if you&#39;d like to visit somewhere to learn more in-person (much in the same way someone today might go to a university known for having experts on a specific topic). And of course for abstract concepts or computer related concepts, you actually <em>can</em> get equivalently hands on experience via the internet as you would in person.</p><p>In this way, the internet would serve as both an archive as well as a way for people to survey topics and find interests that might not have a local presence.</p><p>For what it&#39;s worth, wikipedia is a centralized body of knowledge that does it&#39;s best to allow <em>everyone</em> to contribute. My not requiring some arbitrary credentials or vetting process to edit pages, it allows anyone to contribute, and it tends to work pretty well (with demographic concerns across the editors aside, and that some pages have to be protected due to vandalism). People are able to write about the things they know about, so long as they can back it up with secondary sources.</p><h3 id="literacy" tabindex="-1">Literacy <a class="header-anchor" href="#literacy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Literacy&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Literacy is a tricky counter-point to my ideas on decentralization. Literacy is a topic that most people can agree should be some level of dependency for almost all other knowledge, yet even with our current non-decentralized system where reading and writing is part of every state-level curriculum, <em><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">most adult Americans</a></em> are at least partially illiterate. So it&#39;s hard to suggest that in a self guided system that literacy would <em>improve</em>, right?</p><p>Well first off, let&#39;s be clear that there&#39;s a clear stigmatization of adults with low literacy, and that&#39;s a problem. Society <em>should</em> support people with low literacy. While some of it could certainly be resolved by improving education systems and improving everyone&#39;s material conditions, there&#39;ll likely be some number of people who struggle with literacy into adulthood anyways (for a large variety of reasons!). But of course, it begs the question: if we need to ensure all important information can be accessible without literacy anyways, to what degree <em>would</em> literacy actually be important?</p><p>This is admittedly quite the radical idea and I&#39;m not saying the future of education necessarily <em>will</em> go this direction, but it&#39;s worth considering that certain skills, even some as &quot;fundamental&quot; as reading and writing, may be replaced as time goes on and new technologies develop and accessibility improved. For literacy specifically, I think the success of audio books, phone calls and video calls over texting, audio alternatives to informational plates in museums, and the general trend of replacing text with easily recognizable symbols show are indicative that literacy may just be some antiquated skill on a long enough timescale. At the very least, we should be open to any and all forms of communication that the future might switch to.</p><p>Even important existing books could see this treatment, as even today older books get translated, audiobooks, and adaptations to make them more accessible to modern audiences.</p><p>All that said, short term the solution is <em>definitely</em> improving global material conditions; improving access to quality education, centralized or not; and making important information accessible to people regardless of literacy levels (and ideally regardless of known languages).</p><h2 id="everyone-is-a-teacher" tabindex="-1">Everyone is a Teacher <a class="header-anchor" href="#everyone-is-a-teacher" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Everyone is a Teacher&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The idea of having everyone playing the role of both student and teacher, which means <em>everyone</em> is a teacher, may be controversial. We currently have a system where people spend many years learning various teaching methods, and even then there isn&#39;t consensus over what works best. Who am I, who hasn&#39;t taken those years of learning, to say I think it&#39;s something everyone can do?</p><p>My argument rests upon the idea that teaching is something we all <em>already</em> participate in; that it&#39;s not an exclusive profession that requires dedicated study but something we naturally engage in as part of being within a community. It&#39;s less about being an expert in pedagogy and structured, formal lessons and more about simply sharing what you know with those around you through collaboration and conversation. It&#39;s about fostering an environment where human&#39;s natural curiosity is encouraged, allowing knowledge to flow freely from everyone to everyone.</p><p>I still anticipate people to converse and collaborate on how to best teach while retaining autonomy, but I then expect that knowledge to move across the society through continuing that conversation and collaboration. A society where everyone&#39;s a teacher would naturally highly value that information, so I&#39;d anticipate it to spread wide. There just still wouldn&#39;t be explicit teachers and a hierarchy of teacher vs student. That dynamic can stifle creativity and make learning feel like a chore. The &quot;teacher&quot; being a peer/collaborator makes education more approachable and inclusive and liberatory. It also removes the distinction between when someone is learning a topic and contributing to it, allowing discoveries to come from anyone collaborating.</p><p>Structuring education along these lines, and removing the authority of the teacher, would also reinforce values like equality and challenge ones like seeing age or experience making someone&#39;s ideas not critiquable and able to be improved upon. That&#39;s not to say experience would be discouraged, just that progress can occur without being slowed by new ideas being shut down because they came from someone younger.</p><h2 id="structure" tabindex="-1">Structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Structure&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The structure of this educational system would be very flexible, in order to lean into the idea that students can determine for themselves what they prefer, catering to their own <a href="/garden/learning-styles/">Learning Styles</a>. Some students may prefer the routine of showing up at a specific place at a specific time and learning with the same group of people, despite that no longer being forced upon everyone. Students may also find different approaches useful for different topics, such as using projects to learn programming concepts or lecture halls for physics. For me personally, I think a <a href="/garden/constructivism/">Constructivist</a> approach would have worked the best, and it&#39;s largely how I learn new things today.</p><p>I believe a decentralized educational system could still have places of learning. While there would certainly be a focus on learning through normal every day life, places of learning could help be an environment for learning, containing various educational resources and likely being the place where more abstract concepts are researched and discussed.</p><p>These institutions would likely be managed by those who use it regularly, via <a href="/garden/consensus-democracy/">Consensus Democracy</a>. There would be no costs for anything and likely no degrees or certifications (although I&#39;m not steadfast on that point).</p><h2 id="sensitive-periods" tabindex="-1">Sensitive Periods <a class="header-anchor" href="#sensitive-periods" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sensitive Periods&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When humans are young they have higher neuroplasticity that has been linked to things like better language acquisition and other advantages. A decentralized approach like I described would encourage learning at all periods of life, so would still take advantage of that period of time. But it should be made clear that even if it didn&#39;t, people learn skills later in life all the time and it&#39;s not such a disadvantage as to discourage learning. I think our current system&#39;s focus on grades and rigid curriculums and pacing have done much more hindering of learning than decreased neuroplasticity ever could.</p><h2 id="existing-attempts" tabindex="-1">Existing Attempts <a class="header-anchor" href="#existing-attempts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Existing Attempts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>While a lot of what I described here hinges on the idea of an entire society having a decentralized educational system, and the abolishment of power structures that would hinder such a system from working, there have been attempts at smaller-scale educational systems that allow self guided and self paced interaction, and valuing student autonomy and collaboration amongst each other.</p><p>I&#39;m going to especially highlight Francisco Ferrer and his &quot;Modern School Movement&quot;. Ferrer was a Spanish anarchist, and you can read Emma Goldman&#39;s thoughts on Ferrer on him and his school <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-anarchism-and-other-essays#toc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. Goldman is an influential anarchist herself, and co-founded an association dedicated to spreading Ferrer&#39;s ideas on education as a movement. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find any schools existing in the US today that take direct inspiration from Ferrer.</p><p>Personally, I think the Montessori method and Reggio Emilio approach both sound solid for young children, and we send our son to a Montessori school (although up until our son can walk and eat, its more of a daycare). The Summerhill School and those inspired by it sound like good systems for older children. Some similar alternative schooling systems, like the Sudbury schools, seem to fall into some more conservative values about meritocracy and how not everyone can make it, which I believe would lead to a lack of diversity and reinforcement of power structures. I&#39;d avoid those, and of course do research on the specifics of any school before you entrust them with your child.</p><p>The Zapatistas have a radical approach to education that has a lot of similarities to what I describe here, like giving students a voice in their curricula (via local assembly), eschewing grades and diplomas, and treating education as a lifelong process.</p>',37),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"Decentralized Education","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"decentralized-education","tags":["Education","Decentralized"],"title":"Decentralized Education","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/decentralized-education/index.md","filePath":"garden/decentralized-education/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/decentralized-education/index.md"},v=Object.assign(u,{setup(m){const a=n();return(p,g)=>(l(),i("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[r("2244 words, ~12 minute read.
