I think these share an issue of <em>restricting</em> child autonomy, and I&#39;m not a fan of them. As you can imagine, my desire for the community to be more involved with education (and raising children in general) means I <em>don&#39;t</em> like the idea of further reducing the amount of adults a child regularly interacts with. It leads into the <a href="/garden/neoliberalism/">Neoliberal</a> idea that the parents are solely responsible for their children&#39;s development, rather than the community at large. It&#39;s still dictating a children&#39;s education by a single person or entity.</p><p>But, this is a complicated issue. I&#39;d like public education to be better in the meantime, but I think it does have serious issues and at the moment private education is the only real way of avoiding those issues. So I do not judge those who homeschool, and don&#39;t believe they&#39;re inherently trying to hinder their children&#39;s autonomy and certainly aren&#39;t trying to aversely affect their development. From what I&#39;ve seen, homeschooling parents are aware of the importance of social interactions and make effort to find other social activities for their child to engage with instead.</p><p>Politically, I would rather see our public education system improved rather than switch to something like a voucher system. Until a fair and just society with a decentralized educational system, it&#39;s important to ensure everyone has equal access to a good education, because otherwise education and the opportunities it grants will only serve to reinforce existing power structures.</p><p>The idea of supporting private schools and homeschooling <em>to exert control over your children</em> is harmful. I really emphasize that&#39;s NOT all people who are in favor of homeschooling or private education, but these parents exist and are common. It&#39;s the same parents who are trying to ban certain books from being allowed in school as well. These parents are pretty blatant about their motives for banning books, supporting vouchers, etc. because they do not see an issue with adult supremacy.</p><p>I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNOmFBw1I_M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">What &quot;Parents&#39; Rights&quot; Really Means</a> by leftist educator video essayist Zoe Bee, which goes in depth on this concept and how it can be harmful for children to have their autonomy removed. Beyond this topic, I recommend her entire channel.</p>',8),v=JSON.parse('{"title":"Parent Dictated Education","description":"","frontmatter":{"alias":"Homeschooling","public":"true","slug":"parent-dictated-education","tags":["Parenting","Education"],"title":"Parent Dictated Education","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/parent-dictated-education/index.md","filePath":"garden/parent-dictated-education/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/parent-dictated-education/index.md"},_=Object.assign(u,{setup(m){const a=n();return(p,g)=>(d(),o("div",null,[l,e("p",null,[r("409 words, ~2 minute read.
