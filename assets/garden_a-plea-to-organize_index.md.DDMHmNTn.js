Whether you&#39;re providing aid, receiving it, or working alongside fellow progressives, solidarity is our strongest tool.</p><p>The following is both a call to action and a guide for building a socialist movement that will not only resist but overcome the regressive forces steering our nation.</p><h2 id="the-democrat-party-has-betrayed-you" tabindex="-1">The Democrat Party has Betrayed You <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-democrat-party-has-betrayed-you" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Democrat Party has Betrayed You&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>The US is also a one party state but with typical American extravagance, they have two of them.</p></blockquote><p>-Julius Nyerere</p><p>Trump&#39;s victory isn&#39;t simply a failure of the American electorate—it highlights the absence of a true progressive candidate. The Democrat Party, despite its claims, hasn&#39;t delivered on key progressive issues. From the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civil-rights-act/civil-rights-era.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">civil rights movement</a> to <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/women-of-protest/articles-and-essays/tactics-and-techniques-of-the-national-womans-party-suffrage-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">women&#39;s suffrage</a> to <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/lgbtq-studies/stonewall-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">gay rights</a>, change has always come from grassroots struggle, not the political elites. The Democrat party&#39;s consistent move rightward has betrayed working-class interests, serving capitalist agendas instead.</p><p>While the Biden administration touts economic recovery, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/politics/the-us-economy-is-doing-well-president-biden-wants-to-know-why-so-many-americans-are-still-feeling-bad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">public sentiment doesn&#39;t match</a>. Wage stagnation, unaffordable housing, and unaddressed inflation expose the gap between their rhetoric and the lived experiences of most Americans. Despite popular support and a government trifecta, his administration failed to raise the national minimum wage or fix it to inflation. They&#39;ve failed to institute or expand price controls on food or rent. They passed the inflation reduction act of 2022, but it was not enough.</p><p>Harris&#39; platform was not even <em>socially</em> progressive, as evidenced by their <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kamala-harris-trans-rights-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">non-action on trans rights</a>. Harris dodging a question a month before the election about protecting trans rights by saying &quot;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/election-fact-check-transgender-issues-trump-harris/story?id=115349047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">follow the law</a>&quot;, despite the law currently being transphobic and actively getting worse in many states. She then took a transmedicalist stance on trans rights, saying she only supported gender-affirming care when a doctor deemed it &quot;medically necessary&quot;.</p><p>Harris campaigned on unity and included courting Republican figures like <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-campaign-liz-cheney-election-b2644062.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Liz Cheney</a>. This underscores the Democrats&#39; strategy: appeal to the right, even at the expense of progressive values. This is why &quot;pushing the party left&quot; is a pipe dream - Democrat party leadership would rather lose elections than adopt a truly progressive platform. The DNC has the most clear history of such resistance to progressivism, such as when they ensured Bernie Sanders <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36505419-what-happened-to-bernie-sanders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">could not win</a> the 2016 primaries.</p><h2 id="we-need-a-progressive-movement" tabindex="-1">We Need a Progressive Movement <a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-a-progressive-movement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;We Need a Progressive Movement&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>We may have all come on different ships, but we&#39;re in the same boat now.</p></blockquote><p>- Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>America is at a crossroads. The re-election of Trump signals a dangerous shift toward reactionary politics, but we can&#39;t rely on the Democratic Party to provide an alternative.</p><p>Direct action, especially mutual aid efforts, will be crucial in the coming years. Many marginalized communities will be targeted by the state, and we must be ready to provide support outside of traditional systems that have repeatedly failed them. You can find local mutual aid groups through <a href="https://www.mutualaidhub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mutual Aid Hub</a>, and help your local community.</p><p>Joining local socialist organizations, such as the Party for Socialism and Liberation (<a href="https://pslweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PSL</a>), will help build a strong foundation for a larger political movement. These organizations can serve as vehicles for collective action, allowing us to pool resources, share knowledge, and coordinate efforts on a larger scale.</p><p>If you have local <a href="https://www.unionplus.org/page/how-join-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">unions</a> or <a href="https://letsgo.coop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cooperatives</a> you can join or support, that will also help your fellow comrades and increase the visibility across America of democratic socialist structures working.</p><p>Eventually, our goal must be to replace the Democrat party with a legitimately progressive party. Various progressive policies and ideals are gaining popularity across the nation, regardless of political affiliation: impactful policies like <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">protecting abortion rights</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/04/22/most-americans-support-a-15-federal-minimum-wage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">raising the minimum wage</a>, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/468401/majority-say-gov-ensure-healthcare.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">universal healthcare</a>, or <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/press-release/poll-large-majorities-including-republicans-oppose-discrimination-against-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-people-by-employers-and-health-care-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">protecting trans people</a>. This election campaign has shown us appealing to the right does not bring in new voters, so we must appeal to the left, addressing the material conditions of the working class and uniting people around a shared vision of a better future.</p><h2 id="don-t-be-neutral" tabindex="-1">Don&#39;t be Neutral <a class="header-anchor" href="#don-t-be-neutral" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Don&#39;t be Neutral&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a socialist...</p></blockquote><p>- Martin Niemöller</p><p>In times of political upheaval, apathy is a luxury we cannot afford. Choosing &quot;neutrality&quot; is tacitly supporting the status quo, which continues to harm marginalized communities and entrenches inequality. But worse than apathy is insisting on civility - demanding &quot;polite&quot; protests while ignoring the injustice that fuels them. As <a href="https://housedivided.dickinson.edu/sites/teagle/texts/martin-luther-king-jr-letter-from-birmingham-jail-1963/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dr. MLK Jr. warned</a>, prioritizing order over justice will only perpetuate inequality. Real change requires confronting power structures directly, often outside the confines of &quot;acceptable&quot; political channels.</p><p>America&#39;s political system, with its electoral college, first-past-the-post voting, and powerful lobbying, is inherently undemocratic. These mechanisms are designed to preserve the status quo, limiting real choice and stifling progressive voices. History shows us that meaningful change has rarely come from the ballot box alone but from grassroots activism and sustained pressure. If we want to transform this system, we must do more than vote—we must mobilize, protest, and demand a better future.</p><blockquote><p>Never be deceived that the rich will allow you to vote away their wealth.</p></blockquote><p>- Lucy Parsons</p><h2 id="read-progressive-media" tabindex="-1">Read Progressive Media <a class="header-anchor" href="#read-progressive-media" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Read Progressive Media&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>When I gave food to the poor, they called me a saint. When I asked why the poor have no food, they called me a Communist.</p></blockquote><p>- Dom Helder Camara</p><p>Mainstream media, owned by the capitalist class, will frame progressive issues as divisive or fringe. They will cover our failures but not our successes, and certainly not report on when we need your help.

And if you have the time, reading political theory and understanding class struggle empowers us to cut through propaganda and equip ourselves for the fight ahead. In a world of influencers and culture war politics, improving our political literacy and seeing beyond the Republican vs Democrat dichotomy is imperative.</p><blockquote><p>The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there&#39;s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.</p></blockquote><p>- Noam Chomsky</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Conclusion&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>It is our duty to fight for our freedom.

By organizing, educating, and building solidarity, we can lay the foundation for a progressive future.
