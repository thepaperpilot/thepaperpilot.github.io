It will explore defining the genre, why it&#39;s appealing, and how to design and build your own incremental game. Along the way will be interactive examples, snippets from other creators, and relevant material to contextualize everything.</p><blockquote><p>Note: This is an incomplete document. I want to keep adding opinions and opposing views from other incremental games developers, and add interactive examples to illustrate various points regarding game design and balancing.

What authority do I have to be making this site? I haven&#39;t made the best incremental games, nor the most incremental games, certainly not the most popular ones either. I do have some formal education in game development, know a lot of incremental game devs, as well as other game devs, and an interest in ludology, classifying genres, etc. I&#39;ve also made <a href="https://thepaperpilot.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a couple incremental games</a> myself.</p><p>If you have any additional questions about my credentials or anything on this site, feel free to contact me: I&#39;m &quot;The Paper Pilot&quot; on most social media.
