On traditional social media, this refers to how influencers and advertisers will have their content spread, but also specific posts from smaller posters can get picked up by the algorithm and spread as well.</p><p>Since there&#39;s only so much of people&#39;s attention to go around, social media has been described as an &quot;attention economy&quot;. Under this framework, one could argue that social media is designed for &quot;wealth accumulation&quot;, elevating a handful of accounts to celebrity status and limiting the reach of the masses. This dynamic much reflects the class antagonisms in a capitalist economy.</p><h2 id="people-going-viral" tabindex="-1">People &quot;going viral&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#people-going-viral" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;People &quot;going viral&quot;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>On traditional social media, posts can be picked up by the algorithm and spread far and wide, causing the author to be inundated with unwanted attention, including negative or hateful attention.

This means they have to &quot;jump&quot; between instances (or escape, as he refers to it) in order to spread. This makes the movement much harder to spread across the federated network.</p><p>This may be solved by more properly <a href="/garden/decentralized-social-media/">Decentralized Social Media</a>, since without a concept of instances there would naturally no longer be instance-local hashtags.</p><h3 id="no-politics-rules" tabindex="-1"><a href="/garden/no-politics-rules/">&quot;No Politics&quot; Rules</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#no-politics-rules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[&quot;No Politics&quot; Rules](/garden/no-politics-rules/index.md)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Since some instances on the fediverse have &quot;no politics&quot; rules, movements (which are inherently political) may be suppressed. Since identities are attached to instances, this means those users essentially cannot participate in the movement. Coupled with the usual issues with &quot;no politics&quot; rules, movements can be seriously impeded on the fediverse.</p><p><a href="/garden/decentralized-moderation/">Decentralized Moderation</a> can fix this issue by giving individuals more agency in moderation, and allowing them to evaluate their participation in movements on a case-by-case movement rather than relying on a blanket &quot;no politics&quot; rule</p>',15),b=JSON.parse('{"title":"Virality","description":"","frontmatter":{"public":"true","slug":"virality","title":"Virality","prev":false,"next":false},"headers":[],"relativePath":"garden/virality/index.md","filePath":"garden/virality/index.md"}'),u={name:"garden/virality/index.md"},y=Object.assign(u,{setup(p){const t=o();return(m,g)=>(l(),s("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[n("396 words, ~2 minute read.
