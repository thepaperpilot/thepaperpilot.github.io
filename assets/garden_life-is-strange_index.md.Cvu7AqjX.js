Of the two endings, one very clearly got a lot more resources spent on it, but I think Max&#39;s story has a better conclusion under the other.</p><p>In my mind, Max&#39;s arc (and major themes of the last chapter) was about learning not to rely on her powers, and to learn to live with the consequences of her actions. To that end, having the game end with her taking responsibility and living with the consequences of such a major event is a fitting thematic conclusion to the game and her character arc. In contrast, the other ending shows Max relying on her powers once again and, in my opinion, portrays Max as having not grown nor learned any lessons throughout the entire series. I think its a disservice this ending got so much more attention, with unique outfits and a song dedicated to it.</p><h2 id="life-is-strange-before-the-storm" tabindex="-1">Life is Strange: Before the Storm <a class="header-anchor" href="#life-is-strange-before-the-storm" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Life is Strange: Before the Storm&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I really enjoyed this story. I didn&#39;t get <em>quite</em> as invested, perhaps due to it being a condensed 3 chapters rather than 5, but the characters will still just as amazing, which is what makes LiS so good. The ending didn&#39;t have as much of a punch as LiS1 - in fact, the entire back half of episode 3 didn&#39;t quite meet the bar in my eyes. At the time, I enjoyed these threads discussing criticisms levied at that part of the game:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7l0vgq/bts_e3_did_the_last_playable_scene_feel_off_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7l0vgq/bts_e3_did_the_last_playable_scene_feel_off_to/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7l1i6k/all_inconsistencies_and_general_issues_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7l1i6k/all_inconsistencies_and_general_issues_with/</a></li></ul><p>Deadbones played through the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLweH2EmozgiOuLDIbtyoOnkQ9mWC72HmV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a></p><h2 id="the-awesome-adventures-of-captain-spirit" tabindex="-1">The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-awesome-adventures-of-captain-spirit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I enjoyed the demo, and it certainly got me hyped for LiS2 (although I would&#39;ve been regardless).
