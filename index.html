        <p>I'm Anthony Lawn, or "The Paper Pilot", and I develop free, open source programs and games in my spare time, using a variety of languages and engines. I received my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, and am still there as I pursue my M.S. in Computer Science, with a focus on Human Computer Interaction.</p>

            <p>Babble Buds is a free, open source virtual puppet show engine I made for web and unity, as well as an accompanying electron-based puppet editor and multiplayer stage. Use it for enhancing your digital tabletop roleplaying game, creating silly videos, or even scripting cutscenes in a videogame!</p>

            <p>I was the lead programmer on a team of nine creating this game in a semester long college course. I programmed all the gameplay systems as well as incorporated Babble Buds for the cutscenes and tutorial.</p>

            <p>During the development of this game I discovered my passion for building tools for the game designers to be able to create content as quickly and easily as possible. I even designed a custom editor window that would run simulated matches between two AI opponents to help the game designers test and balance the dice and opponents.
