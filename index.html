        <p>I'm Anthony Lawn, or "The Paper Pilot", and I develop free, open source programs and games in my spare time, using a variety of languages and engines. I received my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, and am still there as I pursue my M.S. in Computer Science, with a focus on Computer Interaction.</p>

                <p>Babble Buds is a free, open source virtual puppet show engine I made for web and unity, as well as an accompanying electron-based puppet editor and multiplayer stage. Use it for enhancing your digital tabletop roleplaying game, creating silly videos, or even scripting cutscenes in a videogame!</p>

                <p>I was the lead programmer on a team of nine creating this game in a semester long college course. I programmed all the gameplay systems as well as incorporated Babble Buds for the cutscenes and tutorial.</p>

                <p>This is a screenshot from a prototype of a VR project I made with Grant Barbee. It involves manipulating cards in a rougelike dungeon crawler in VR, taking advantage of the medium with meta-abilities like throwing a card at an enemy to deal ranged damage and remove the card from your deck!</p>
