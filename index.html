          I'm Anthony Lawn, or "The Paper Pilot". My passion is computer science, which you can see from my history of software engineering and game development stretching across desktop, web, and mobile applications. I'm currently attending the University of Texas at Dallas, working towards a B.S. in Computer Science.
