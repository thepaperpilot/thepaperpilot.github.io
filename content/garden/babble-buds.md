[Babble Buds](http://babblebuds.xyz) is a tool for creating puppets and interacting with puppets controlled by others on a shared stage

> Note: I need to move the website off replit because of their monetization strategy changing. In the meantime, you can check it out from its [github repository](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/babble-buds)

Inspired by Puppet Pals by Robert Moran

Intended for use in RPG Campaigns

The renderer was separated into its own project, [babble.js](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/babble.js), so it could be used for stuff like cutscenes

I ported the engine to C# and used it for the cutscenes in [Dice Armor](/garden/dice-armor)
- I don't believe I ever separated it out into its own project, but you can find the code [here](https://github.com/sreynoldsdesign/dice_armor/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/babble.cs)
