An [Open Source](/garden/open-source) [Matrix](/garden/matrix) web client built to be better for communities than anything else out there
- Currently in development
- Exposes certain channels such that they are web indexable
- Will include features like [Chat Glue](/garden/chat-glue) and communal [Digital Gardens](/garden/digital-gardens)

Created by [Erlend Sogge Heggen](https://writing.exchange/@erlend), a ex-employee from Discourse
- Maintains the [Commune Blog](https://blog.commune.sh) with great write ups on the issues of the modern web, social media, etc. and how they can be improved (by Commune or related projects)
- Also maintains a [Personal Blog](https://blog.erlend.sh) about similar topics

The Commune community is very interested in various topics and how they can relate together:
- [Federated Identity](/garden/federated-identity)
- [Personal Web](/garden/the-small-web)
- [Digital Gardens](/garden/digital-gardens)
- [Social Media](/garden/social-media)
- The common themes here are they want these things [Decentralized](/garden/decentralized) and [Freeform](/garden/freeform)
- They're also building [Weird](/garden/weird) to make several of these more accessible

- [@laxla@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@laxla) is creating Gimli, a federated discord alternative
	- Built on ActivityPub
	- "Guild-based" in ways matrix is not?
	- Will integrate with F3 as well
	- Wants to handle blogging as well
	- Certainly seems similar to Commune's message gardening concept
