Traditional social media
- Not [Decentralized](/garden/decentralized)
	- Can't choose your own rules, sorting methods, data queries, etc.
- Overrun by scams and ads and influencers

[Federated Social Media](/garden/fediverse)
- Partially [Decentralized](/garden/decentralized)
	- Self hosting is too hard for everyone to do
	- Still subject to instance's moderation, limitations, etc.
- Users need to pick an instance, associating their identity with one specific group
	- People belong to many groups
	- The person is permanently associated with that one group
	- You have to pick before getting a "trial period" to ensure you actually like that group/instance
