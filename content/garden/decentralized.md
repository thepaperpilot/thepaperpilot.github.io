Something with no central source of authority

Common examples:
- RSS
- Email
- The [Fediverse](/garden/fediverse)

In practice, the "pick a server" problem causes email and the fediverse to trend towards a handful of large servers that still suffer from some of the issues of centralization

Advantages over centralization:
- Data ownership
- Increased privacy
- No rules to follow
- Can fully customize your experience
- No single entity can make the experience worse for everyone
- Anyone and everyone can try their hand at improving the ecosystem
