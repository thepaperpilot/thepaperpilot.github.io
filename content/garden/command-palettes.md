Command palettes are a design pattern where apps expose functionality through a search bar

Typing what you want is almost certainly easier and faster than finding the action in some submenu or remembering an arcane hotkey
- Especially with fuzzy search that also looks through descriptions of actions
- Command palettes scale very well with large amounts of actions

Maggie Appleton discusses this pattern in her article on [Command K Bars](https://maggieappleton.com/command-bar)
- The name comes from the fact many apps use the ctrl/cmd k shortcut to open the command palette
