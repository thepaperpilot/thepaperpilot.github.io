> Art is never finished, only abandoned.
> \- Leonardo Da Vinci

This quote intrigues me and feels quite relatable. I've struggled with perfectionism (and in fact it's a large theme in Kronos), something Leonardo famously did as well. This quote feels like an exit ticket to getting out of perfectionist thinking - if art is _never_ finished, then when its "done" (abandoned) is arbitrary. Perhaps that's why Leonardo left so many WIPs behind in his journal - if the point at which you abandon them is arbitrary, then why not abandon projects early?
