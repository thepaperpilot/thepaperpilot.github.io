I believe trans athletes should be allowed in sports. They do not need a separate category, and should be allowed to pick if they compete with those of their gender assigned at birth or how they identify now.

The main argument against the above is that it invalidates the perceived fairness of the sport. However, fairness as a concept is inherently subjective and influenced by many rules and assumptions we as a society made up and are now using for the express purpose of discriminating against trans individuals.

Gender is a social construct, but so is sex: we've created an arbitrary definition to separate male and female that, due to being overly rigid, fails to handle edge cases like women with naturally higher testosterone levels, or individuals with atypical amounts of x and/or y chromosomes, or atypical sets of body parts. These distinctions do not need to exist.

The typical arguments for separating the sexes in sports is because testosterone is a performance enhancing substance, so those who naturally produce more of it should have their own category, for reasons similar to those of weight classes in boxing. However, other biological advantages do not warrant separate classes, like Phelp's webbed feet or atypical lactic acid production. In fact, many athletes are even allowed to take performance enhancing drugs like Adderall to combat biological disadvantages like ADHD. But not all drugs are banned or permitted equally - caffeine is a stimulant like Adderall but is allowed to be taken by anyone. Even the distinction of what a drug is is arbitrary, as protein powder is a substance that improves performance but is not considered a drug.

There are many advantages one might have in sports, but contrary to a true meritocracy, our arbitrary distinctions on allowed vs disallowed advantages exposes the biases of our society, which are often racist, sexist, and transphobic. Therefore, appeals to "fairness" are explicit endorsements of those biases, namely bigotry. Even if you do agree with some of the arbitrary distinctions I've brought up, that doesn't detract from the point that they _are_ arbitrary and subjective.
