This "now page" offers a big picture glimpse into what Iâ€™m focused on at this point in my life. [What is a now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

## Digital Gardens

I've been learning about a ton of concepts that I think can be interestingly combined; namely [The Small Web](/garden/the-small-web), [Digital Garden](/garden/digital-gardens)s, [Commune](/garden/commune), and [Local-First Software](undefined). I have an idea for a digital garden that is structured like a network of topics and includes conversations, pages, and citations about each topic. I want to build it on the [Agentic fediverse](undefined) so clients can build a large network by subscribing to community made networks across the fediverse.

Ultimately, I think this project could have some implications on how _this_ digital garden operates, so I've decided to stop further indieweb integrations like webmentions for now. I'd like to see a server be able to bridge indieweb and agentic fediverse posts, and start using the agentic fediverse posts as my new source of truth.

## Incremental Social

I'm running and improving the social media site [Incremental Social](/garden/incremental-social), along with CardboardEmpress.

I'd like to look into it eventually hosting a bridge between the mbin AP actors and [Agentic fediverse](undefined) identities.

## Chromatic Lattice

I'm working on a multiplayer incremental game called [Chromatic Lattice](/garden/chromatic-lattice) .

## Kronos

I'm working on a long single player narratively driven incremental game called [Kronos](/garden/kronos) . This is a very long-term project.
