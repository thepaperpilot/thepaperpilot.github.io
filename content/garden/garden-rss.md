A theoretical alternative to RSS that's better for [Freeform](/garden/freeform) websites (and [Digital Gardens](/garden/digital-gardens) specifically )

Why is it useful?
- [Feeds are not fit for gardening](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/essays/feeds-are-not-fit-for-gardening/)
	- Describes the issues with RSS for [Digital Gardens](/garden/digital-gardens)
	- Proposes creating an alternative, which they call `grdn`

How should it work?
- Could display changes similar to git diffs

Existing Work
- [`grdn` Specification](https://github.com/chriskrycho/grdn/blob/main/SPEC.md)
- [Proposal to build set of extensions to RSS](https://forum.summerofprotocols.com/t/pig-rss-all-the-things/383)
