This is my knowledge hub!
- It's a [Digital Garden](/garden/digital-gardens) collecting my thoughts in varying levels of completeness on basically anything I have interest in

This is not Wikipedia. My thoughts are biased and argumentative, but to the best of my ability based on fact and expertise

<span id="6637b86a-3603-45ef-a21e-b33c7d96c529">I'm writing on _something_ essentially every day</span>
- Most of my pages are private, especially the journal pages
- I'll only push updates to this site every so often (not an automatic process)
- Until something like [Garden-RSS](/garden/garden-rss) exists, we'll have to make do with [/changelog](https://thepaperpilot.org/changelog) which gives a git diff summary for every pushed change, in the form of a [The IndieWeb](/garden/the-small-web) stream as well as an RSS feed

Written in [Logseq](/garden/logseq) and rendered with [Vitepress](/garden/vitepress)

I want to utilize the strategies described in [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zPKTSiU725W9WQCqoVPBcxm) to help improve my digital garden
