Play it [here](https://thepaperpilot.org/gamedevtree)!

My first (good) incremental game! (My actual first was [Shape Tycoon](https://thepaperpilot.itch.io/shape-tycoon) - I don't recommend it!)

It's [Open Source](/garden/open-source)!

The [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGameDevTree) page on this game mentions some of the cool things about this game
