# Planet Farm!

**[Store Page](https://thepaperpilot.itch.io/planet-farm)**
**[Source Code](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/PlanetFarm)**

Originally supposed to be a game, it's current state is more of a simulator.

Create and mutate and breed planets. Browse a collection of procedurally generated planets. To be honest it was really just a way for me to learn new things, dealing with 3D and moving cameras in 3D space, etc.
