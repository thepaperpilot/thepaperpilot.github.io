# 12 is Strange!

**[Store Page](http://thepaperpilot.itch.io/12-is-strange)**
**[Source Code](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/12-is-strange)**

This is a game made in under 48 hours for UT Dallas' SDGA Fall 2015 Game Jam!

I want to at some point flesh this out into an entire, original game (and less of a Life is Strange fan game)
