          This is a game made in under 48 hours for UT Dallas' SDGA Fall 2015 Game Jam!
        </p>
        <p>
          With the game jam done, the next step for this game is to rewrite and expand the story. During this, the adherence to the "12" theme may be compromised, so on the store page there will also be a download link to the "Game Jam version" of the game.
        </p>

          The game can play in your browser, and will if you go to the store page below.
